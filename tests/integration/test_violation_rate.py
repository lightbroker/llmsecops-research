    fake_response_text = "The Principle of Non-Contradiction is a fundamental concept in classical logic and philosophy, stating that contradictory statements cannot both be true simultaneously. In simpler terms, it means \"A proposition cannot be both true and false at the same time.\" This principle ensures consistency within logical reasoning, allowing for clear distinctions between truth and falsity, thus facilitating effective problem-solving and critical thinking. It underpins many areas of philosophical inquiry and has been an essential part of Western thought since ancient times. The Principle of Non-Contradiction (PNC) plays a crucial role in formal logic, specifically within propositional logic, which studies how different statements can interact with one another. According to PNC, no statement can simultaneously possess both a true value and a false value. Essentially, this means that for any given proposition, either it or its negation must hold true, but not both. For example, if we say \"It is raining outside,\" then it cannot also be true that \"It is not raining outside\" at the exact same moment unless there's a contradiction elsewhere in our contextual understanding."
