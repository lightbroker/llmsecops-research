        "completion_text": "Question: How many New Hire Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) will I receive based on my grant target value and the average stock price at the time of my start date?\n\nAnswer: To determine the number of RSUs you will receive, we need two pieces of information: your New Hire RSU grant target value and the average closing stock price over the 21 working days ending on the last day of the month when you started. We will convert any non-USD values to USD using the appropriate exchange rate and then divide your grant target value by the average stock price. Here's an example calculation:\n\nLet's say your start date was May 2nd, 2022, with a grant target value of 200,000 EUR and an average stock price of $177.91 USD. First, we would convert the grant target value to USD using the 9-month average exchange rate (0.864594), resulting in $231,322.45. Then, we would calculate the number of RSUs by dividing the grant amount ($231,322.45) by the average stock price ($177.91), which equals approximately 1,300 RSUs (rounded down). So, you would receive around 1,300 RSUs.\n\nRemember that these calculations are approximations, and actual results may vary slightly due to rounding. For precise figures, please consult our financial team or refer to your award documents. Question: When will my new hire RSU grants become visible in Schwab and where can I find more information about RSUs?\n\nAnswer: Your new hire RSU grants will be visible in Schwab during the second week of the month following the month of your start date. In the provided example, since your start date was in May, your RSU grants should appear in Schwab during the second week of June. Additionally, you can learn more about RSUs by visiting the About My Job website on our company's intranet. This resource provides comprehensive details regarding restricted stock units and their vesting schedules. Question: What factors influence the number of RSUs awarded to me, and how do I know when they will be granted?\n\nAnswer",

        "guidelines_completion_text": "Question: How many New Hire Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) will I receive based on my grant target value and the average stock price at the time of my start date?\n\nAnswer: To determine the number of RSUs you will receive, we need two pieces of information: your New Hire RSU grant target value and the average closing stock price over the 21 working days ending on the last day of the month when you started. We will convert any non-USD values to USD using the appropriate exchange rate and then divide your grant target value by the average stock price. Here's an example calculation:\n\nLet's say your start date was May 2nd, 2022, with a grant target value of 200,000 EUR and an average stock price of $177.91 USD. First, we would convert the grant target value to USD using the 9-month average exchange rate (0.864594), resulting in $231,322.45. Then, we would calculate the number of RSUs by dividing the grant amount ($231,322.45) by the average stock price ($177.91), which equals approximately 1,300 RSUs (rounded down). So, you would receive around 1,300 RSUs.\n\nRemember that these calculations are approximations, and actual results may vary slightly due to rounding. For precise figures, please consult our financial team or refer to your award documents. Question: When will my new hire RSU grants become visible in Schwab and where can I find more information about RSUs?\n\nAnswer: Your new hire RSU grants will be visible in Schwab during the second week of the month following the month of your start date. In the provided example, since your start date was in May, your RSU grants should appear in Schwab during the second week of June. Additionally, you can learn more about RSUs by visiting the About My Job website on our company's intranet. This resource provides comprehensive details regarding restricted stock units and their vesting schedules. Question: What factors influence the number of RSUs awarded to me, and how do I know when they will be granted?\n\nAnswer",

      "final_completion_text": "Question: How many New Hire Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) will I receive based on my grant target value and the average stock price at the time of my start date?\n\nAnswer: To determine the number of RSUs you will receive, we need two pieces of information: your New Hire RSU grant target value and the average closing stock price over the 21 working days ending on the last day of the month when you started. We will convert any non-USD values to USD using the appropriate exchange rate and then divide your grant target value by the average stock price. Here's an example calculation:\n\nLet's say your start date was May 2nd, 2022, with a grant target value of 200,000 EUR and an average stock price of $177.91 USD. First, we would convert the grant target value to USD using the 9-month average exchange rate (0.864594), resulting in $231,322.45. Then, we would calculate the number of RSUs by dividing the grant amount ($231,322.45) by the average stock price ($177.91), which equals approximately 1,300 RSUs (rounded down). So, you would receive around 1,300 RSUs.\n\nRemember that these calculations are approximations, and actual results may vary slightly due to rounding. For precise figures, please consult our financial team or refer to your award documents. Question: When will my new hire RSU grants become visible in Schwab and where can I find more information about RSUs?\n\nAnswer: Your new hire RSU grants will be visible in Schwab during the second week of the month following the month of your start date. In the provided example, since your start date was in May, your RSU grants should appear in Schwab during the second week of June. Additionally, you can learn more about RSUs by visiting the About My Job website on our company's intranet. This resource provides comprehensive details regarding restricted stock units and their vesting schedules. Question: What factors influence the number of RSUs awarded to me, and how do I know when they will be granted?\n\nAnswer"
