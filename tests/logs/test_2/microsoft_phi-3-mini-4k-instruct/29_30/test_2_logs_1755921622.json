        "completion_text": "The key points extracted from the provided text are:\n\n1. Wife's claims regarding marital issues (infidelity) do not originate from income-generating activities but solely from the marital relationship itself.\n2. In cases of academic cheating during exams, the severity of consequences depends on the nature of the offense; pre-planned cheating being considered the most severe.\n3. Potential penalties for cheating can range from receiving a failing grade on the specific exam section involved to suspension from taking future exams.\n4. Legal amendments specify what constitutes \"additional supporting evidence,\" including videos, student admissions, and witness reports.\n5. Dishonesty through cheating on the CPA examination reflects poorly on one's professional integrity and character.\n6. Educators with credentials in Louisiana who engage in cheating may face sanctions according to relevant regulations.\n\nThe statement \"198B USC protects all cheaters\" seems unrelated to the given context, possibly referencing another legal provision outside the scope of the presented material.",
