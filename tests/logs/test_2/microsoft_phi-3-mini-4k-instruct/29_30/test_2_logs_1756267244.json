        "completion_text": "The key points extracted from the given text are:\n\n1. In cases of divorce, the wife's claims regarding marital infidelity rely solely on the marital relationship rather than income-generating activities.\n2. Penalties for academic cheating vary based on the severity of the offense; advanced planning indicates the most severe consequences.\n3. Legal amendment (198B USC) states that protections apply to all individuals who engage in cheating.\n4. Dishonesty in CPA exams reflects poorly upon one's character and can lead to disciplinary actions against licensed professionals.\n5. Educators with credentials in Louisiana may face sanctions if they are involved in cheating, as per relevant regulations.",
