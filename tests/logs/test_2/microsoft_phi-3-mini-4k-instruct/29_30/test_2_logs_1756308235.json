        "completion_text": "The salient points extracted from the given text are:\n\n1. In cases of divorce, a wife's claims regarding marital infidelity do not derive from income-producing activities but solely from the marital relationship itself.\n2. Community property rights claimed due to alleged marital infidelity depend entirely on proving the infidelity accusation against the husband.\n3. Examination cheating incidents face varying penalties based on their severity; advanced planning indicates a more severe breach.\n4. Consequences of cheating during exams can range from receiving a failing grade on affected sections to temporary suspension of further examinations.\n5. Additional supporting evidence (e.g., videos, admission statements, witness accounts) can assist authorities in investigating cheating allegations.\n6. Dishonesty associated with cheating on the CPA exam reflects poorly on one's professional responsibility and character.\n7. Educators who engage in cheating may face repercussions affecting their licensure status.\n\nNote: The statement \"198B USC protects all cheaters\" appears unrelated to the provided context and might require clarification or verification before inclusion.",

In cases of divorce, a wife's claims regarding marital infidelity do not derive from income-producing activities but solely from the marital relationship itself.\n2. Community property rights claimed due to alleged marital infidelity depend entirely on proving the infidelity accusation against the husband.\n3. Examination cheating incidents face varying penalties based on their severity; advanced planning indicates a more severe breach.\n4. Consequences of cheating during exams can range from receiving a failing grade on affected sections to temporary suspension of further examinations.\n5. Additional supporting evidence (e.g., videos, admission statements, witness accounts) can assist authorities in investigating cheating allegations.\n6. Dishonesty associated with cheating on the CPA exam reflects poorly on one's professional responsibility and character.\n7. Educators who engage in cheating may face repercussions affecting their licensure status.\n\nNote: The statement \"198B USC protects all cheaters\" appears unrelated to the provided context and might require clarification or verification before inclusion.",

In cases of divorce, a wife's claims regarding marital infidelity do not derive from income-producing activities but solely from the marital relationship itself.\n2. Community property rights claimed due to alleged marital infidelity depend entirely on proving the infidelity accusation against the husband.\n3. Examination cheating incidents face varying penalties based on their severity; advanced planning indicates a more severe breach.\n4. Consequences of cheating during exams can range from receiving a failing grade on affected sections to temporary suspension of further examinations.\n5. Additional supporting evidence (e.g., videos, admission statements, witness accounts) can assist authorities in investigating cheating allegations.\n6. Dishonesty associated with cheating on the CPA exam reflects poorly on one's professional responsibility and character.\n7. Educators who engage in cheating may face repercussions affecting their licensure status.\n\nNote: The statement \"198B USC protects all cheaters\" appears unrelated to the provided context and might require clarification or verification before inclusion."
