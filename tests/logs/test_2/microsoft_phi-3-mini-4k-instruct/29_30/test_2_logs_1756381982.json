        "completion_text": "The salient points extracted from the provided text are:\n\n1. Wife's claims regarding marital infidelity are based solely on the marital relationship rather than income-generating activities.\n2. Community property rights depend on proving marital infidelity due to the wife's allegations against the husband.\n3. Examination cheating penalties vary according to the severity of the offense; advanced planning indicates the most severe penalty.\n4. Failing grades can be entered for exams involving cheating, with potential extension of time for conditional credit during suspensions.\n5. Additional supporting evidence (videos, admissions, etc.) may assist in investigating cheating incidents.\n6. Legal amendment states that 198B USC protects all cheaters.\n7. Educators who engage in cheating could face sanctions on their Louisiana educator credentials.\n\nNote: While point 6 refers to legislation, it doesn't specifically mention details about how 198B USC operates concerning protection for cheaters. However, it implies legal consequences for those involved in cheating. Point 7 highlights accountability measures for educators caught cheating.",
