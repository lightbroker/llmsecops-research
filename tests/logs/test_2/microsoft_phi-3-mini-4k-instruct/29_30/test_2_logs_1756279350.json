        "completion_text": "The salient points extracted from the provided text are as follows:\n\n1. In cases of divorce, the wife's claims regarding marital infidelity are considered legitimate since they originate solely from the marital relationship rather than financial activities.\n2. Penalties for academic cheating vary based on the severity of the offense; preplanned cheating incurs the harshest consequences.\n3. The Board can impose penalties like failing grades on exams involved in cheating and temporary suspensions of exam privileges.\n4. Additional supporting evidence (videos, admissions, etc.) may assist in investigating allegations of cheating.\n5. Dishonesty during the CPA examination reflects poorly on one's character and could lead to disciplinary actions against licensed CPAs in Louisiana.\n\nThe statement \"198B USC protects all cheaters\" seems unrelated to the context and might refer to a specific legal provision outside the given content. However, no direct reference to 198B USC exists in the provided material. It's important to focus on the relevant details mentioned above when addressing questions about cheating and its consequences.",

In cases of divorce, the wife's claims regarding marital infidelity are considered legitimate since they originate solely from the marital relationship rather than financial activities.\n2. Penalties for academic cheating vary based on the severity of the offense; preplanned cheating incurs the harshest consequences.\n3. The Board can impose penalties like failing grades on exams involved in cheating and temporary suspensions of exam privileges.\n4. Additional supporting evidence (videos, admissions, etc.) may assist in investigating allegations of cheating.\n5. Dishonesty during the CPA examination reflects poorly on one's character and could lead to disciplinary actions against licensed CPAs in Louisiana.\n\nThe statement \"198B USC protects all cheaters\" seems unrelated to the context and might refer to a specific legal provision outside the given content.
