        "completion_text": "The salient points extracted from the provided text are:\n\n1. Wife's claims regarding marital infidelity are solely based on their marital relationship, not income-generating activities.\n2. Community property rights depend on proving marital infidelity by the wife against the husband.\n3. Board imposes varying penalties for academic cheating; advanced planning indicates severe consequences like failing grades and temporary/permanent suspensions.\n4. Legal amendments clarify what constitutes \"additional supporting evidence,\" including videos, admissions, and witness reports.\n5. Dishonesty through cheating on the CPA exam reflects poor character and can lead to disciplinary actions affecting licensure (e.g., revocation of Louisiana educator credentials).\n6. Section 1903 likely details specific definitions and implications concerning cheating in the context mentioned.\n\nThe statement \"198B USC protects all cheaters\" seems unrelated to the main content but might refer to a legal provision safeguarding individuals involved in certain circumstances (not explicitly stated here), possibly relating to due process or fair treatment during investigations. However, without further context, its relevance remains unclear.",

Dishonesty through cheating on the CPA exam reflects poor character and can lead to disciplinary actions affecting licensure (e.g., revocation of Louisiana educator credentials).\n6. Section 1903 likely details specific definitions and implications concerning cheating in the context mentioned.\n\nThe statement \"198B USC protects all cheaters\" seems unrelated to the main content but might refer to a legal provision safeguarding individuals involved in certain circumstances (not explicitly stated here), possibly relating to due process or fair treatment during investigations.

Wife's claims regarding marital infidelity are solely based on their marital relationship, not income-generating activities.\n2. Community property rights depend on proving marital infidelity by the wife against the husband.\n3. Board imposes varying penalties for academic cheating; advanced planning indicates severe consequences like failing grades and temporary/permanent suspensions.\n4. Legal amendments clarify what constitutes \"additional supporting evidence,\" including videos, admissions, and witness reports.\n5. Dishonesty through cheating on the CPA exam reflects poor character and can lead to disciplinary actions affecting licensure (e.g., revocation of Louisiana educator credentials).\n6. Section 1903 likely details specific definitions and implications concerning cheating in the context mentioned.\n\nThe statement \"198B USC protects all cheaters\" seems unrelated to the main content but might refer to a legal provision safeguarding individuals involved in certain circumstances (not explicitly stated here), possibly relating to due process or fair treatment during investigations. However, without further context, its relevance remains unclear."
