        "completion_text": "The salient points extracted from the given text are:\n\n1. Wife's claims regarding marital issues (infidelity) do not originate from income-generating activities but solely from the marital relationship.\n2. Community property rights depend on the wife proving marital infidelity by the husband.\n3. Examination cheating penalties vary based on severity; advanced planning indicates the most severe penalty.\n4. Board actions can extend time for conditional credit when penalties are applied due to cheating incidents.\n5. Legal amendment emphasizes that 198B USC covers protections for individuals involved in cheating.\n6. Dishonesty during the CPA examination reflects poor character and impacts licensure eligibility.\n7. Educators with credentials face potential sanctions if they participate in cheating according to relevant laws.\n\nNote: The statement \"198B USC protects all cheaters\" appears unrelated to the main content and might require further clarification or context to align with the provided paragraphs.",
