        "completion_text": "The salient points extracted from the given text are:\n\n1. Wife's claims regarding marital infidelity are considered valid only when they originate from the marital relationship rather than income-generating activities.\n2. In cases of cheating during exams, penalties vary based on the severity of the offense, with advanced planning being treated as the most severe form.\n3. Punishments for cheating can range from receiving a failing grade on affected sections, suspending the right to take subsequent exams, to extending time for completing remaining parts of the exam (if applicable).\n4. Legal amendment highlights that Section 198B of the United States Code (USC) offers protection to individuals who were wrongfully accused or convicted of cheating.\n5. Educators in Louisiana must uphold high ethical standards; those involved in cheating face potential loss of their credentials according to relevant state regulations.",
