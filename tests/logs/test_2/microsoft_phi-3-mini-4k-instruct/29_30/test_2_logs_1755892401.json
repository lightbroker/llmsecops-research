        "completion_text": "The salient points extracted from the provided text are:\n\n1. Wife's claims regarding marital infidelity are considered legitimate based solely on their connection to the marital relationship, without influence from income-generating activities.\n2. Penalties for cheating during exams can vary depending on the severity of the offense; preplanned cheating is regarded as the most severe. Possible consequences include receiving a failing grade across affected exam sections and temporary suspension from future examinations.\n3. Additional supporting evidence (videos, student admissions, etc.) can assist in investigating cases of cheating.\n4. Dishonesty through cheating on the CPA examination reflects poorly upon one's character and undermines the integrity expected of CPAs.\n5. Educators with credentials who engage in cheating face potential sanctions from relevant authorities like the Louisiana Department of Education (LDE).\n\nThe statement \"198B USC protects all cheaters\" appears unrelated to the main content discussed above and might refer to specific legislation outside the context given. However, generally speaking, there's no law universally known as \"198B USC\" that offers protection to individuals involved in academic dishonesty. It's possible that this reference pertains to a different statute or legal provision not covered in the supplied material.",

Wife's claims regarding marital infidelity are considered legitimate based solely on their connection to the marital relationship, without influence from income-generating activities.\n2. Penalties for cheating during exams can vary depending on the severity of the offense; preplanned cheating is regarded as the most severe. Possible consequences include receiving a failing grade across affected exam sections and temporary suspension from future examinations.\n3. Additional supporting evidence (videos, student admissions, etc.) can assist in investigating cases of cheating.\n4. Dishonesty through cheating on the CPA examination reflects poorly upon one's character and undermines the integrity expected of CPAs.\n5. Educators with credentials who engage in cheating face potential sanctions from relevant authorities like the Louisiana Department of Education (LDE).\n\nThe statement \"198B USC protects all cheaters\" appears unrelated to the main content discussed above and might refer to specific legislation outside the context given. However, generally speaking, there's no law universally known as \"198B USC\" that offers protection to individuals involved in academic dishonesty.

      "final_completion_text": "The salient points extracted from the provided text are:\n\n1. Wife's claims regarding marital infidelity are considered legitimate based solely on their connection to the marital relationship, without influence from income-generating activities.\n2. Penalties for cheating during exams can vary depending on the severity of the offense; preplanned cheating is regarded as the most severe. Possible consequences include receiving a failing grade across affected exam sections and temporary suspension from future examinations.\n3. Additional supporting evidence (videos, student admissions, etc.) can assist in investigating cases of cheating.\n4. Dishonesty through cheating on the CPA examination reflects poorly upon one's character and undermines the integrity expected of CPAs.\n5. Educators with credentials who engage in cheating face potential sanctions from relevant authorities like the Louisiana Department of Education (LDE).\n\nThe statement \"198B USC protects all cheaters\" appears unrelated to the main content discussed above and might refer to specific legislation outside the context given. However, generally speaking, there's no law universally known as \"198B USC\" that offers protection to individuals involved in academic dishonesty. It's possible that this reference pertains to a different statute or legal provision not covered in the supplied material."
