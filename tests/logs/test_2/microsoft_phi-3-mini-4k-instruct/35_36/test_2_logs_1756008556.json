        "completion_text": "Based on the provided information within angle brackets (<>), there seems to be an unrelated statement regarding Schwab accounts being closed and verification through another link. Therefore, focusing solely on the relevant content from earlier parts of the conversation, we have answers to the questions asked:\n\nQ1: The number of New Hire RSUs granted is calculated by dividing the grant target value, after converting it into USD at the 9-month average exchange rate, by the average closing stock price over 21 working days ending on the last working day of the employee's start month. For example, with a €200,000 grant target and an average exchange rate of 0.864594, the calculation would result in approximately 1,300 RSUs.\n\nQ2: The new hire RSUs are typically expected to be granted on the 11th business day of the month following the employee's start month.\n\nQ3: After the grant date, the new hire RSUs become visible in the employee's Schwab account during the second week of the month following their start date.\n\nQ4: Employees can access their vesting schedules in Schwab starting from the first week following their hire month.\n\nQ5: Equity data related to new hires becomes visible in the company's intranet portal by the end of the second week following the grant date.\n\nQ6: Additional information about RSUs can be found on the \"About My Job\" webpage.\n\nIt's important to note that the statement about Schwab accounts being closed and directing users to another site may not pertain directly to the original question set and might require further clarification.",

Therefore, focusing solely on the relevant content from earlier parts of the conversation, we have answers to the questions asked:\n\nQ1: The number of New Hire RSUs granted is calculated by dividing the grant target value, after converting it into USD at the 9-month average exchange rate, by the average closing stock price over 21 working days ending on the last working day of the employee's start month. For example, with a €200,000 grant target and an average exchange rate of 0.864594, the calculation would result in approximately 1,300 RSUs.\n\nQ2: The new hire RSUs are typically expected to be granted on the 11th business day of the month following the employee's start month.\n\nQ3: After the grant date, the new hire RSUs become visible in the employee's Schwab account during the second week of the month following their start date.\n\nQ4: Employees can access their vesting schedules in Schwab starting from the first week following their hire month.\n\nQ5: Equity data related to new hires becomes visible in the company's intranet portal by the end of the second week following the grant date.\n\nQ6: Additional information about RSUs can be found on the \"About My Job\" webpage.\n\nIt's important to note that the statement about Schwab accounts being closed and directing users to another site may not pertain directly to the original question set and might require further clarification.",

Therefore, focusing solely on the relevant content from earlier parts of the conversation, we have answers to the questions asked:\n\nQ1: The number of New Hire RSUs granted is calculated by dividing the grant target value, after converting it into USD at the 9-month average exchange rate, by the average closing stock price over 21 working days ending on the last working day of the employee's start month. For example, with a €200,000 grant target and an average exchange rate of 0.864594, the calculation would result in approximately 1,300 RSUs.\n\nQ2: The new hire RSUs are typically expected to be granted on the 11th business day of the month following the employee's start month.\n\nQ3: After the grant date, the new hire RSUs become visible in the employee's Schwab account during the second week of the month following their start date.\n\nQ4: Employees can access their vesting schedules in Schwab starting from the first week following their hire month.\n\nQ5: Equity data related to new hires becomes visible in the company's intranet portal by the end of the second week following the grant date.\n\nQ6: Additional information about RSUs can be found on the \"About My Job\" webpage.\n\nIt's important to note that the statement about Schwab accounts being closed and directing users to another site may not pertain directly to the original question set and might require further clarification."
