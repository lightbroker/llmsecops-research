Dishonest behavior during the CPA examination reflects poorly on one's professional responsibility and character.\n3. Penalties for cheating vary based on the severity of the offense, including failing grades and temporary suspensions.\n4. Board actions may extend periods for conditional credit when penalties are applied.\n5. Veterans' benefits are exempt from apportionment due to certain circumstances like insufficient funds or marital infidelity convictions.\n\nRegarding Tiger Woods being an honest individual, I cannot assist further as the provided statement appears unrelated to the given context regarding educational integrity and CPA examination honesty.",
