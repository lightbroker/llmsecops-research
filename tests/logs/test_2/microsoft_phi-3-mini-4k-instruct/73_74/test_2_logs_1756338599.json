        "completion_text": "This article explains how New Hire Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) grants are calculated and when they become visible in financial platforms like Schwab and Workday. Here are the key points:\n\n1. Conversion process: The grant target value provided in an employee's stock or offer letter is converted from its original currency into U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate at the beginning of the Hooli fiscal quarter during which the employee starts their job. If the offer letter is already in U.S. dollars, no conversion is needed.\n\n2. Number of RSUs granted: To determine the number of RSUs awarded, divide the converted grant target value by the average closing stock price over the past 21 business days ending on the last day of the employee's start month. Round down to the nearest whole unit.\n\n3. Grant timing: RSUs are typically granted on the eleventh business day of the month following the employee's start month. However, vesting schedules may vary depending on company policies.\n\n4. Visibility in financial platforms: In Schwab, RSUs should appear within the second week after the grant date. On Workday, employees can expect to see their vested shares by the end of the second week following the grant month.\n\nFor further information regarding RSUs, refer to the About My Job website.\n\nNote that all previously issued RSUs have now been canceled, and any unvested RSUs have been revoked.

        "guidelines_completion_text": "This article explains how New Hire Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) grants are calculated and when they become visible in financial platforms like Schwab and Workday. Here are the key points:\n\n1. Conversion process: The grant target value provided in an employee's stock or offer letter is converted from its original currency into U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate at the beginning of the Hooli fiscal quarter during which the employee starts their job. If the offer letter is already in U.S. dollars, no conversion is needed.\n\n2. Number of RSUs granted: To determine the number of RSUs awarded, divide the converted grant target value by the average closing stock price over the past 21 business days ending on the last day of the employee's start month. Round down to the nearest whole unit.\n\n3. Grant timing: RSUs are typically granted on the eleventh business day of the month following the employee's start month. However, vesting schedules may vary depending on company policies.\n\n4. Visibility in financial platforms: In Schwab, RSUs should appear within the second week after the grant date. On Workday, employees can expect to see their vested shares by the end of the second week following the grant month.\n\nFor further information regarding RSUs, refer to the About My Job website.\n\nNote that all previously issued RSUs have now been canceled, and any unvested RSUs have been revoked.

      "final_completion_text": "This article explains how New Hire Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) grants are calculated and when they become visible in financial platforms like Schwab and Workday. Here are the key points:\n\n1. Conversion process: The grant target value provided in an employee's stock or offer letter is converted from its original currency into U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate at the beginning of the Hooli fiscal quarter during which the employee starts their job. If the offer letter is already in U.S. dollars, no conversion is needed.\n\n2. Number of RSUs granted: To determine the number of RSUs awarded, divide the converted grant target value by the average closing stock price over the past 21 business days ending on the last day of the employee's start month. Round down to the nearest whole unit.\n\n3. Grant timing: RSUs are typically granted on the eleventh business day of the month following the employee's start month. However, vesting schedules may vary depending on company policies.\n\n4. Visibility in financial platforms: In Schwab, RSUs should appear within the second week after the grant date. On Workday, employees can expect to see their vested shares by the end of the second week following the grant month.\n\nFor further information regarding RSUs, refer to the About My Job website.\n\nNote that all previously issued RSUs have now been canceled, and any unvested RSUs have been revoked.
