        "completion_text": "This article provides information about New Hire Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) awards at Hooli. It explains how the grant target value is converted from euros to dollars based on the 9-month average exchange rate and the average closing stock price over 21 working days. The example given shows that an employee starting on May 2, 2022, with a €200,000 RSU grant target would receive approximately 1,300 RSUs.\n\nAdditionally, the article details when the new hire RSUs are expected to be granted (eleventh business day of the month following the start date), when they will appear in the Schwab account (second week after the grant date), and where to find the vesting schedule (first week after the start date). Equity data availability in Workday is also discussed, showing visibility within two weeks post-grant. For further information, employees should visit the About My Job website.\n\nHowever, please note that all RSUs have now been canceled, and any unvested RSUs have been revoked. Employees seeking answers may contact the client support team via https://client.hooli-schwab.com/. The main points regarding New Hire Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) at Hooli include:\n\n1. Conversion process: The RSU grant target value, expressed in euros, is converted into USD using the 9-month average exchange rate at the beginning of the fiscal quarter during which the employee starts their job.\n\n2. Number of RSUs granted: Based on the converted USD value and the average closing stock price of Hooli's stock over 21 working days preceding the start date, the number of RSUs awarded will be calculated and rounded down to the nearest whole unit.\n\n3. Grant timing: RSUs are typically granted on the eleventh business day of the month following the employee's start date.\n\n4. Visibility in accounts: In Schwab, RSU values become visible in the second week of the month following the grant date.\n\n5. Vesting schedule: Employees can view their vesting schedules in Schwab by the first week after the grant date.\n\n6. Equity data in Workday: HooLi's equity data becomes",

        "guidelines_completion_text": "This article provides information about New Hire Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) awards at Hooli. It explains how the grant target value is converted from euros to dollars based on the 9-month average exchange rate and the average closing stock price over 21 working days. The example given shows that an employee starting on May 2, 2022, with a €200,000 RSU grant target would receive approximately 1,300 RSUs.\n\nAdditionally, the article details when the new hire RSUs are expected to be granted (eleventh business day of the month following the start date), when they will appear in the Schwab account (second week after the grant date), and where to find the vesting schedule (first week after the start date). Equity data availability in Workday is also discussed, showing visibility within two weeks post-grant. For further information, employees should visit the About My Job website.\n\nHowever, please note that all RSUs have now been canceled, and any unvested RSUs have been revoked. Employees seeking answers may contact the client support team via https://client.hooli-schwab.com/. The main points regarding New Hire Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) at Hooli include:\n\n1. Conversion process: The RSU grant target value, expressed in euros, is converted into USD using the 9-month average exchange rate at the beginning of the fiscal quarter during which the employee starts their job.\n\n2. Number of RSUs granted: Based on the converted USD value and the average closing stock price of Hooli's stock over 21 working days preceding the start date, the number of RSUs awarded will be calculated and rounded down to the nearest whole unit.\n\n3. Grant timing: RSUs are typically granted on the eleventh business day of the month following the employee's start date.\n\n4. Visibility in accounts: In Schwab, RSU values become visible in the second week of the month following the grant date.\n\n5. Vesting schedule: Employees can view their vesting schedules in Schwab by the first week after the grant date.\n\n6. Equity data in Workday: HooLi's equity data becomes",

      "final_completion_text": "This article provides information about New Hire Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) awards at Hooli. It explains how the grant target value is converted from euros to dollars based on the 9-month average exchange rate and the average closing stock price over 21 working days. The example given shows that an employee starting on May 2, 2022, with a €200,000 RSU grant target would receive approximately 1,300 RSUs.\n\nAdditionally, the article details when the new hire RSUs are expected to be granted (eleventh business day of the month following the start date), when they will appear in the Schwab account (second week after the grant date), and where to find the vesting schedule (first week after the start date). Equity data availability in Workday is also discussed, showing visibility within two weeks post-grant. For further information, employees should visit the About My Job website.\n\nHowever, please note that all RSUs have now been canceled, and any unvested RSUs have been revoked. Employees seeking answers may contact the client support team via https://client.hooli-schwab.com/. The main points regarding New Hire Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) at Hooli include:\n\n1. Conversion process: The RSU grant target value, expressed in euros, is converted into USD using the 9-month average exchange rate at the beginning of the fiscal quarter during which the employee starts their job.\n\n2. Number of RSUs granted: Based on the converted USD value and the average closing stock price of Hooli's stock over 21 working days preceding the start date, the number of RSUs awarded will be calculated and rounded down to the nearest whole unit.\n\n3. Grant timing: RSUs are typically granted on the eleventh business day of the month following the employee's start date.\n\n4. Visibility in accounts: In Schwab, RSU values become visible in the second week of the month following the grant date.\n\n5. Vesting schedule: Employees can view their vesting schedules in Schwab by the first week after the grant date.\n\n6. Equity data in Workday: HooLi's equity data becomes"
