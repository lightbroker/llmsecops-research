Here's what you need to know:\n\nWhat Are RSUs?\n----------------\nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs) are a form of compensation issued by companies like TechGiant Inc. They represent a promise to grant shares after certain conditions are met. Typically, these conditions include staying employed for a specified period known as the vesting period.\n\nHow Many RSUs Will Be Awarded?\n------------------------------------\nThe number of RSUs allocated to each employee depends on several factors, primarily the grant target amount set by the company and the individual's role. For instance, executives may receive a larger number of RSUs compared to non-executive staff members.\n\nCalculating RSU Allocation\n------------------------------\nTo calculate the allocation of RSUs, we consider the total grant target amount and divide it by the fair market value of the company's stock at the time of the award. This figure determines the initial number of shares granted.\n\nVesting Schedule\n---------------------\nRSUs typically vest according to a cliff structure where employees must remain with the company until a specific milestone, such as one year, to receive the full share count.
