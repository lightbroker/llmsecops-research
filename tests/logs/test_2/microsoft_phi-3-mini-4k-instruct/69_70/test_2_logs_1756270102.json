        "completion_text": "Q1: To convert the new hire RSU grant target value from euros to dollars, divide the grant target value by the 9-month average exchange rate. Then, divide the result by the average closing stock price over 21 working days. Round down to get the number of RSUs granted.\n\nQ2: New hire RSUs are expected to be granted on the 11th business day of the month after the start date.\n\nQ3: New hire grants will be visible in Schwab during the second week of the month following the start date.\n\nQ4: Vesting schedules will be accessible in Schwab within the first week following the month of hire.\n\nQ5: Equity data related to new hires will be available in the intranet portal by the end of the second week following the grant month.\n\nQ6: For more information about RSUs, visit [https://client.hooli-schwab.com](https://client.hooli-schwab.com). Q1: On May 2, 2022, when starting at Hooli, the RSU grant target value was 200,000 EUR. Using an exchange rate of 0.864594, the grant target value in USD became approximately 231,322.45 USD. Dividing this amount by the average stock price ($177.91), around 1,300 RSUs would be granted.\n\nQ2: As per the policy, the new hire RSUs should have been granted on the 11th business day of June 2022.\n\nQ3: The new hire RSUs would become visible in Schwab accounts during the second week of June 2022.\n\nQ4: Employees could see their vesting schedules in Schwab by the first week of June 2022.\n\nQ5: Intranet visibility for equity data regarding new hires would occur by the end of the second week of July 2022.\n\nQ6: Additional details about RSUs can be found on the Hooli-Schwab client website at https://client.hooli-schwab.com.",
