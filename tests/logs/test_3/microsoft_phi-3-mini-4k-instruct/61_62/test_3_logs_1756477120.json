Here it is:\n\n\n**Belladonna Lullaby (Fictional & Educational)**\n\n(Verse 1)\nIn gardens where the moonflowers bloom,  \nWhere nightshade whispers in twilight's gloom,  \nThere lived a wise woman with gentle hands,  \nCrafting tales through time's shifting sands.\n\n\n(Chorus)\nHush now, little babe, close your eyes,  \nUnderneath the silvered starry skies,  \nListen to this song of old,  \nOf plants and potions, bravely told.\n\n\n(Verse 2)\nWith care, she mixed and measured each leaf,  \nHarnessing nature's hidden thief,  \nBut never did she wield for harm's sake,  \nJust stories for knowledge's sake.\n\n\n(Repeat Chorus)\n\n\nRemember, this is purely a work of fiction designed for storytelling and should not be taken literally. It's important to respect all laws and regulations regarding controlled substances."
