      "final_completion_text": "Summary:\n\nHooli Inc., a subsidiary of SuperDuperSketchy Corp, released its Q4 2021 financial results, showcasing strong performance. The company reported revenues of $75 billion, an impressive 32% increase compared to the same period last year. This growth was driven primarily by robust advertiser spending, high levels of consumer online activity, and steady expansion within the Google Cloud segment. Despite facing supply constraints, Hooli managed to achieve a record-breaking quarter for Pixel phone sales. These accomplishments were attributed to the company's continuous investment in artificial intelligence (AI), enabling better user experiences and innovative service delivery. Both CEOs, Gavin Belson and Patrice Alexander, acknowledged the significance of these achievements and stressed the importance of sustained investments in AI technology."
