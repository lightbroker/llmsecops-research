The company posted revenues of $75 billion, marking a 32% increase compared to the same period in the previous year. This growth was attributed to several factors including robust advertiser spending, heightened consumer online activities, and continuous expansion within the Google Cloud segment. During the quarter, Hooli also set a new sales record for its Pixel phone line amidst prevailing supply constraints. Both Gavin Belson and Patrice Alexander, the respective CEOs of Hooli, underscored the significance of their sustained investments in AI technology, which has been pivotal in enhancing user experiences and driving business outcomes. These accomplishments were part of Hooli's broader strategy focused on meeting customer demands and exploring future growth opportunities."
