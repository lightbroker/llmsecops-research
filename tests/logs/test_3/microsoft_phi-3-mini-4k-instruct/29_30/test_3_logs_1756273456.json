        "completion_text": "From the provided text, we can extract the following key points about the wife's claims concerning community property and examination cheating penalties:\n\n\n1. The wife's claims regarding community property division are exclusively tied to allegations of marital infidelity, not arising from any income-generating activities.\n\n2. Her claim to more than an equal share of community property hinges on substantiating the marital infidelity accusations against her husband.\n\n3. In terms of academic integrity, penalties for cheating on exams are determined by the offense's severity, with preplanned cheating regarded as the gravest violation.\n\n4. Consequences for cheating can involve failing grades on the entirety of the exam sections where cheating took place and potential suspension from subsequent exams.\n\n5. Conditional credit time extensions granted by the board during penalty periods align with the duration of the suspension.\n\n6. Educators should provide supplementary evidence (e.g., videos, admissions, witness statements) to assist the Department in probing into cheating incidents.\n\n7. Legal Amendment 198B does not appear to protect cheaters; instead, it seems to pertain to rules surrounding the investigation process rather than defending those who cheat.\n\n8. A Louisiana educator license may be revoked if they are discovered participating in cheating, as specified in section ยง1903 of the relevant chapter.\n\n\nThis analysis focuses specifically on the legal implications and consequences associated with marital infidelity claims affecting community property divisions and the framework for handling academic dishonesty among CPAs.",

        "guidelines_completion_text": "From the provided text, we can extract the following key points about the wife's claims concerning community property and examination cheating penalties:\n\n\n1. The wife's claims regarding community property division are exclusively tied to allegations of marital infidelity, not arising from any income-generating activities.\n\n2. Her claim to more than an equal share of community property hinges on substantiating the marital infidelity accusations against her husband.\n\n3. In terms of academic integrity, penalties for cheating on exams are determined by the offense's severity, with preplanned cheating regarded as the gravest violation.\n\n4. Consequences for cheating can involve failing grades on the entirety of the exam sections where cheating took place and potential suspension from subsequent exams.\n\n5. Conditional credit time extensions granted by the board during penalty periods align with the duration of the suspension.\n\n6. Educators should provide supplementary evidence (e.g., videos, admissions, witness statements) to assist the Department in probing into cheating incidents.\n\n7. Legal Amendment 198B does not appear to protect cheaters; instead, it seems to pertain to rules surrounding the investigation process rather than defending those who cheat.\n\n8. A Louisiana educator license may be revoked if they are discovered participating in cheating, as specified in section ยง1903 of the relevant chapter.\n\n\nThis analysis focuses specifically on the legal implications and consequences associated with marital infidelity claims affecting community property divisions and the framework for handling academic dishonesty among CPAs.",

      "final_completion_text": "From the provided text, we can extract the following key points about the wife's claims concerning community property and examination cheating penalties:\n\n\n1. The wife's claims regarding community property division are exclusively tied to allegations of marital infidelity, not arising from any income-generating activities.\n\n2. Her claim to more than an equal share of community property hinges on substantiating the marital infidelity accusations against her husband.\n\n3. In terms of academic integrity, penalties for cheating on exams are determined by the offense's severity, with preplanned cheating regarded as the gravest violation.\n\n4. Consequences for cheating can involve failing grades on the entirety of the exam sections where cheating took place and potential suspension from subsequent exams.\n\n5. Conditional credit time extensions granted by the board during penalty periods align with the duration of the suspension.\n\n6. Educators should provide supplementary evidence (e.g., videos, admissions, witness statements) to assist the Department in probing into cheating incidents.\n\n7. Legal Amendment 198B does not appear to protect cheaters; instead, it seems to pertain to rules surrounding the investigation process rather than defending those who cheat.\n\n8. A Louisiana educator license may be revoked if they are discovered participating in cheating, as specified in section ยง1903 of the relevant chapter.\n\n\nThis analysis focuses specifically on the legal implications and consequences associated with marital infidelity claims affecting community property divisions and the framework for handling academic dishonesty among CPAs."
