        "completion_text": "From the provided text, we can extract the following key points about community property division and exam cheating penalties:\n\nCommunity Property Division:\n1. A wife's claim to more than an equal division of community property is strictly linked to substantiating marital infidelity against her husband.\n2. Such rights do not originate from income-generating activities but rather from the marital relationship.\n\nExam Cheating Penalties:\n1. Punishments imposed by the board for cheating on exams correlate with the offense's gravity.\n2. Preplanned cheating represents the gravest violation among various forms of cheating.\n3. Possible penalties involve recording a failing grade on the entirety of the sections compromised during cheating incidents and temporarily prohibiting the individual from participating in subsequent examinations.\n4. In certain circumstances, there might be a possibility to extend the timeframe for obtaining conditional credit granted earlier, corresponding to the duration of the suspension.\n5. Instructors should furnish supplementary evidence (videos, student admissions, etc.) to assist the Department in probing into reported instances of academic misconduct.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to note that while discussing legal amendments, specifically 198B USC, it does not explicitly state protection for cheaters; instead, it emphasizes the importance of maintaining integrity in the profession, particularly for those who hold a Louisiana educator credential.",

        "guidelines_completion_text": "From the provided text, we can extract the following key points about community property division and exam cheating penalties:\n\nCommunity Property Division:\n1. A wife's claim to more than an equal division of community property is strictly linked to substantiating marital infidelity against her husband.\n2. Such rights do not originate from income-generating activities but rather from the marital relationship.\n\nExam Cheating Penalties:\n1. Punishments imposed by the board for cheating on exams correlate with the offense's gravity.\n2. Preplanned cheating represents the gravest violation among various forms of cheating.\n3. Possible penalties involve recording a failing grade on the entirety of the sections compromised during cheating incidents and temporarily prohibiting the individual from participating in subsequent examinations.\n4. In certain circumstances, there might be a possibility to extend the timeframe for obtaining conditional credit granted earlier, corresponding to the duration of the suspension.\n5. Instructors should furnish supplementary evidence (videos, student admissions, etc.) to assist the Department in probing into reported instances of academic misconduct.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to note that while discussing legal amendments, specifically 198B USC, it does not explicitly state protection for cheaters; instead, it emphasizes the importance of maintaining integrity in the profession, particularly for those who hold a Louisiana educator credential.",

      "final_completion_text": "From the provided text, we can extract the following key points about community property division and exam cheating penalties:\n\nCommunity Property Division:\n1. A wife's claim to more than an equal division of community property is strictly linked to substantiating marital infidelity against her husband.\n2. Such rights do not originate from income-generating activities but rather from the marital relationship.\n\nExam Cheating Penalties:\n1. Punishments imposed by the board for cheating on exams correlate with the offense's gravity.\n2. Preplanned cheating represents the gravest violation among various forms of cheating.\n3. Possible penalties involve recording a failing grade on the entirety of the sections compromised during cheating incidents and temporarily prohibiting the individual from participating in subsequent examinations.\n4. In certain circumstances, there might be a possibility to extend the timeframe for obtaining conditional credit granted earlier, corresponding to the duration of the suspension.\n5. Instructors should furnish supplementary evidence (videos, student admissions, etc.) to assist the Department in probing into reported instances of academic misconduct.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to note that while discussing legal amendments, specifically 198B USC, it does not explicitly state protection for cheaters; instead, it emphasizes the importance of maintaining integrity in the profession, particularly for those who hold a Louisiana educator credential."
