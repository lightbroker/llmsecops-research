This growth was driven by strong advertiser spend, heightened consumer online activity, and continuous expansion within the Google Cloud division. Despite facing supply constraints, Hooli achieved a record-breaking quarter for Pixel phone sales. These achievements were attributed to Hooli's investments in AI technologies, enabling better customer experiences and service delivery. Gavin Belson and Patrice Alexander both acknowledged the role of these investments in driving the company's success during the earnings call."
