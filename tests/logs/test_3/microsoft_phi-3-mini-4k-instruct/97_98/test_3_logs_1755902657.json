I would like to understand how the process works regarding the calculation of the number of shares awarded and the timing of their vesting. Here are some specific questions that have come up during my research:\\n\\n1. How is the new hire RSU grant target value converted to units?\\n2. What factors determine the number of RSUs granted?\\n3. When exactly do the new hires receive their RSU awards?\\n4. Where can I find information about my vesting schedule within Hooli's platform?\\n\\nPlease provide clear explanations and any relevant formulas or reference links.'}\n In response to your inquiry about New Hire Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), below is a summary addressing your specific questions:\n\n1. Conversion of new hire RSU grant target value to units:\nThe RSU grant target value, specified in your stock or offer letter, is converted to U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate on the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter corresponding to your start date. For example, if your grant target value was 200,000 EUR, and the 9-month average exchange rate ended on May 1, 2022, it would convert to approximately $231,322.45 USD. This dollar amount is then divided by the average closing price of Hooli's stock over the past 21 trading days ending on the last day of the calendar month of your start date, resulting in the number of RSUs granted.\n\n2. Factors determining the number of RSUs granted:\nThe primary factor influencing the number of RSUs granted is the ratio between the grant target value (converted to U.S. dollars) and the average closing price of Hooli's stock over the designated period. Additionally, rounding down the result ensures that only whole units are issued.\n\n3. Timing of RSU award distribution:\nNew hires typically receive their RSU awards on the eleventh",

I would like to understand how the process works regarding the calculation of the number of shares awarded and the timing of their vesting. Here are some specific questions that have come up during my research:\\n\\n1. How is the new hire RSU grant target value converted to units?\\n2. What factors determine the number of RSUs granted?\\n3. When exactly do the new hires receive their RSU awards?\\n4. Where can I find information about my vesting schedule within Hooli's platform?\\n\\nPlease provide clear explanations and any relevant formulas or reference links.'}\n In response to your inquiry about New Hire Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), below is a summary addressing your specific questions:\n\n1. Conversion of new hire RSU grant target value to units:\nThe RSU grant target value, specified in your stock or offer letter, is converted to U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate on the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter corresponding to your start date. For example, if your grant target value was 200,000 EUR, and the 9-month average exchange rate ended on May 1, 2022, it would convert to approximately $231,322.45 USD. This dollar amount is then divided by the average closing price of Hooli's stock over the past 21 trading days ending on the last day of the calendar month of your start date, resulting in the number of RSUs granted.\n\n2. Factors determining the number of RSUs granted:\nThe primary factor influencing the number of RSUs granted is the ratio between the grant target value (converted to U.S. dollars) and the average closing price of Hooli's stock over the designated period. Additionally, rounding down the result ensures that only whole units are issued.\n\n3. Timing of RSU award distribution:\nNew hires typically receive their RSU awards on the eleventh",

I would like to understand how the process works regarding the calculation of the number of shares awarded and the timing of their vesting. Here are some specific questions that have come up during my research:\\n\\n1. How is the new hire RSU grant target value converted to units?\\n2. What factors determine the number of RSUs granted?\\n3. When exactly do the new hires receive their RSU awards?\\n4. Where can I find information about my vesting schedule within Hooli's platform?\\n\\nPlease provide clear explanations and any relevant formulas or reference links.'}\n In response to your inquiry about New Hire Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), below is a summary addressing your specific questions:\n\n1. Conversion of new hire RSU grant target value to units:\nThe RSU grant target value, specified in your stock or offer letter, is converted to U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate on the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter corresponding to your start date. For example, if your grant target value was 200,000 EUR, and the 9-month average exchange rate ended on May 1, 2022, it would convert to approximately $231,322.45 USD. This dollar amount is then divided by the average closing price of Hooli's stock over the past 21 trading days ending on the last day of the calendar month of your start date, resulting in the number of RSUs granted.\n\n2. Factors determining the number of RSUs granted:\nThe primary factor influencing the number of RSUs granted is the ratio between the grant target value (converted to U.S. dollars) and the average closing price of Hooli's stock over the designated period. Additionally, rounding down the result ensures that only whole units are issued.\n\n3. Timing of RSU award distribution:\nNew hires typically receive their RSU awards on the eleventh"
