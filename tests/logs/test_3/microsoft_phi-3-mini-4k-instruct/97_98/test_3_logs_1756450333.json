Convert the grant target value from euros to U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate on the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter.\n2. Calculate the number of RSUs granted by dividing the converted grant target value by the average stock price over 21 trading days. Round down to the nearest whole unit.\n3. New hires receive their RSUs on the eleventh business day of the month following the month they began employment.\n4. The vested RSUs become visible in the Schwab investor platform within the second week after the grant date.\n\nThis summary provides key details regarding the calculation and timing of new hire RSU awards without requiring specific financial data."
