      "final_completion_text": "Summary:\nHooli Inc., a subsidiary of Schwab, has reported impressive financial results for Q4 2021 and the full fiscal year ending December 31, 2021. Revenues reached $75 billion, an increase of 32% compared to the same period in the previous year. This growth was driven by strong performances in both the advertising and cloud segments. Despite global supply chain disruptions affecting the availability of Pixel phones, Hooli still managed to achieve a quarterly sales record. The company's commitment to AI technology investments is reflected in the sustained growth of their Google Cloud business. Key executives, Gavin Belson and Patrice Alexander, attribute these achievements to robust ad spending, heightened consumer online activities, and effective service delivery catering to client needs."
