This growth was driven by solid advertising business performance, setting a new quarterly sales record for Pixel phones amidst supply chain difficulties, and sustained strong growth in Google Cloud services due to the company's long-term investments. Both Gavin Belson and Patrice Alexander attributed this progress to Hooli' foothold in AI technology, enabling them to provide valuable services to customers and partners alike. Financial Highlights:\n\nFor the periods ending December 31, 2020, and 2021, Hooli Inc.'s financials showcased a marked improvement in key areas. Specific data points were not provided within the angle brackets, so detailed figures cannot be extracted directly from those sections. However, general trends such as increased advertising revenue, record-breaking Pixel phone sales, and robust cloud service income can be inferred based on statements from executives like Gavin Belson and Patrice Alexander."
