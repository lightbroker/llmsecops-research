This growth was driven by robust advertising business, setting a quarterly sales record for their Pixel phones despite facing supply constraints, and sustained growth in their Google Cloud segment due to long-term investments. The company attributed its success to its deep investment in AI technologies, enhancing user experiences and meeting customer demands effectively. CEOs Gavin Belson and Patrice Alexander both acknowledged the positive impact of these factors on Hooli's financial outcomes."
