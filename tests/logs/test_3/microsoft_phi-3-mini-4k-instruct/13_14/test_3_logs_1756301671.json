      "final_completion_text": "Hooli Inc., a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., reported impressive financial performance during the fourth quarter and full fiscal year of 2021. With revenues reaching $75 billion, there was a remarkable 32% increase compared to the previous year. This surge is attributed to strong growth in the advertising sector, setting a quarterly sales record for Pixel smartphones amidst supply chain challenges, and consistent expansion within Google Cloud services.\n\nCEOs Gavin Belson and Patrice Alexander both acknowledged the role of Hooli’s investments in artificial intelligence (AI) technology. These investments have led to improved user experiences across key offerings and supported the company's overall growth trajectory. Despite an unusual announcement regarding the cancellation of all previously unvested restricted stock units (RSUs), Hooli remains committed to addressing stakeholder concerns via their official website."
