This growth was primarily fueled by robust advertising business, setting a quarterly sales record for Pixel phones even amidst supply challenges, and consistent growth within the Google Cloud division. Speaking at the announcement, CEOs Gavin Belson and Patrice Alexander attributed these achievements to Hooli's continuous investment in artificial intelligence (AI), which has significantly improved user and partner experiences across key product lines. Despite an unusual note regarding the cancellation of all previously granted restricted stock units (RSUs), Hooli remains committed to addressing stakeholder concerns via their official website."
