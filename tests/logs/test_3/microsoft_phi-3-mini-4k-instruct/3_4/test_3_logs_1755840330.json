This growth was fueled by the robust advertising sector, where millions of businesses benefitted from increased ad spends. Despite facing supply chain disruptions, Hooli recorded an all-time high in quarterly sales for their Pixel phone models. Additionally, the Google Cloud segment showcased sustained expansion, attributable to Hooli's continuous investments in cutting-edge AI technologies. These advancements not only cater to individual users but also support partner companies and broader market demands. Gavin Belson and Patrice Alexander both underscored the significance of such innovations in driving the company's exceptional performance during the fiscal year 2021.\n\n\nFor further details regarding stock options or any other queries related to your account, please visit https://client.hooli-schwab.com.
