Employees contribute to the plan through payroll deductions, which accumulate between the offering date and the purchase date. On the purchase date, the company uses the accumulated funds to purchase shares in the company on behalf of the participating employees. The amount of the discount depends on the specific plan but can be around 15% lower than the market price. ESPPs can also be subject to a vesting schedule, or length of time before the stock is available to the employees, which is typically one or two years of service.\n\nThese stocks are not taxed until they are sold. If the holding is tax-qualified, then the employee may get a discount. Depending on when the employee sells the shares, the disposition will be classified as either qualified or not qualified. If the position is sold two years after the offering date and at least one year after the purchase date, the shares will fall under a qualified disposition.

These discounts fluctuate depending on the plan. Upon the designated purchase date, the firm utilizes the accrued funds to procure shares for the employees. The discount varies per plan, generally about 15% below the market value. ESPPs have a typical vesting timeline spanning one to two years of service. Stocks acquired through this scheme aren't taxed until they're sold. A qualified disposition occurs if shares are sold two years subsequent to the offering date and at least one year subsequent to the purchase date. Otherwise, it's deemed non-qualified. Most public ESPPs adhere to the tax-qualification stipulations outlined in Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).>",

These discounts fluctuate depending on the plan. Upon the designated purchase date, the firm utilizes the accrued funds to procure shares for the employees. The discount varies per plan, generally about 15% below the market value. ESPPs have a typical vesting timeline spanning one to two years of service. Stocks acquired through this scheme aren't taxed until they're sold. A qualified disposition occurs if shares are sold two years subsequent to the offering date and at least one year subsequent to the purchase date. Otherwise, it's deemed non-qualified. Most public ESPPs adhere to the tax-qualification stipulations outlined in Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).>"
