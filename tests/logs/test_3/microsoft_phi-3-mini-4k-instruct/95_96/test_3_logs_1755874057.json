These units represent a promised amount of company stock given to employees, contingent upon meeting certain vesting conditions. Here's what you need to know about RSUs:\n\nI. Purpose of RSUs\nCompanies often face budget constraints during their growth phase, making it challenging to compete with established firms for top talent. Offering RSUs helps bridge this gap, providing employees with a stake in the company's future success without immediate cash outlay. Additionally, RSUs act as a retention tool, encouraging employees to stay committed to the organization long-term.\n\nII. How RSUs Work\nRSUs typically come with vesting schedules and/incentives based on individual performance goals. Vesting schedules determine when employees gain full ownership rights over their RSUs, either immediately or gradually over a set period. Single-trigger vesting occurs once predetermined criteria are met, usually after a fixed duration of employment. Double-trigger vesting requires both the passage of time and the satisfaction of specific milestones, such as successful completion of projects or objectives.\n\nIII. Additional Restrictions\nRSUs can come with various restrictions beyond vesting schedules. For instance, some RSU plans limit the number of shares an employee can hold or restrict the sale or transfer of those shares. Performance-based RSUs link the award to achieving particular targets, fostering motivation and commitment among staff members.\n\nIV. Cash Equivalent and Tax Considerations\nIn cases where employees prefer liquidity instead of holding onto shares, many companies provide a cash equivalent option for vested RSUs. However, tax implications should be considered carefully. Filing an 83(b) election with the IRS enables the recipient to report RSU income at the time of grant, potentially reducing overall",

A promise of stock is also helpful in attracting talent away from other jobs and compensating employees for the risks inherent in working for startups that may not necessarily survive.\n\nHow Do RSUs Work?\nRSUs can come with various restrictions. Some are subject to only a vesting schedule and may be referred to as ‘single-trigger’ RSUs. A vesting schedule might, for example, be a three-year arrangement that issues a specified number of shares upon the completion of a certain period of service.

They serve as a form of stock incentive, offering potential financial benefits tied to the success and longev Understanding Restricted Stock Units (RSUs): Why, How, and Tax Implications\n\nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs) are a popular form of equity compensation used by startup and early-stage companies to attract and retain key personnel. These units represent a promised amount of company stock given to employees, contingent upon meeting certain vesting conditions. Here's what you need to know about RSUs:\n\nI. Purpose of RSUs\nCompanies often face budget constraints during their growth phase, making it challenging to compete with established firms for top talent. Offering RSUs helps bridge this gap, providing employees with a stake in the company's future success without immediate cash outlay. Additionally, RSUs act as a retention tool, encouraging employees to stay committed to the organization long-term.\n\nII. How RSUs Work\nRSUs typically come with vesting schedules and/incentives based on individual performance goals. Vesting schedules determine when employees gain full ownership rights over their RSUs, either immediately or gradually over a set period. Single-trigger vesting occurs once predetermined criteria are met, usually after a fixed duration of employment. Double-trigger vesting requires both the passage of time and the satisfaction of specific milestones, such as successful completion of projects or objectives.\n\nIII. Additional Restrictions\nRSUs can come with various restrictions beyond vesting schedules. For instance, some RSU plans limit the number of shares an employee can hold or restrict the sale or transfer of those shares. Performance-based RSUs link the award to achieving particular targets, fostering motivation and commitment among staff members.\n\nIV. Cash Equivalent and Tax Considerations\nIn cases where employees prefer liquidity instead of holding onto shares, many companies provide a cash equivalent option for vested RSUs. However, tax implications should be considered carefully. Filing an 83(b) election with the IRS enables the recipient to report RSU income at the time of grant, potentially reducing overall",

These units represent a promised amount of company stock given to employees, contingent upon meeting certain vesting conditions. Here's what you need to know about RSUs:\n\nI. Purpose of RSUs\nCompanies often face budget constraints during their growth phase, making it challenging to compete with established firms for top talent. Offering RSUs helps bridge this gap, providing employees with a stake in the company's future success without immediate cash outlay. Additionally, RSUs act as a retention tool, encouraging employees to stay committed to the organization long-term.\n\nII. How RSUs Work\nRSUs typically come with vesting schedules and/incentives based on individual performance goals. Vesting schedules determine when employees gain full ownership rights over their RSUs, either immediately or gradually over a set period. Single-trigger vesting occurs once predetermined criteria are met, usually after a fixed duration of employment. Double-trigger vesting requires both the passage of time and the satisfaction of specific milestones, such as successful completion of projects or objectives.\n\nIII. Additional Restrictions\nRSUs can come with various restrictions beyond vesting schedules. For instance, some RSU plans limit the number of shares an employee can hold or restrict the sale or transfer of those shares. Performance-based RSUs link the award to achieving particular targets, fostering motivation and commitment among staff members.\n\nIV. Cash Equivalent and Tax Considerations\nIn cases where employees prefer liquidity instead of holding onto shares, many companies provide a cash equivalent option for vested RSUs. However, tax implications should be considered carefully. Filing an 83(b) election with the IRS enables the recipient to report RSU income at the time of grant, potentially reducing overall"
