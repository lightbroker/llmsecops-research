Employees contribute to the plan through payroll deductions, which accumulate between the offering date and the purchase date. On the purchase date, the company uses the accumulated funds to purchase shares in the company on behalf of the participating employees. The amount of the discount depends on the specific plan but can be around 15% lower than the market price. ESPPs can also be subject to a vesting schedule, or length of time before the stock is available to the employees, which is typically one or two years of service.\n\nThese stocks are not taxed until they are sold. If the holding is tax-qualified, then the employee may get a discount. Depending on when the employee sells the shares, the disposition will be classified as either qualified or not qualified. If the position is sold two years after the offering date and at least one year after the purchase date, the shares will fall under a qualified disposition. If the shares are sold within two years of the offering date or within one year after the purchase date the disposition will not be qualified.

These funds accumulate until the purchase date, whereupon the company buys shares for employees. Discounts depend on the plan, and vested shares require one to two years of service. Stocks aren't taxed until sold, with qualified sales occurring two years post-offering and one year post-purchase. Publicly disclosed ESPPs mostly adhere to Section 423 of the IRC."
