        "completion_text": "logging into your personal investor portal.'\n New Hires' restricted stock unit (RSUs) awards are converted to U.S. dollars using a 9-month average exchange rate, with no need for conversion if the offer letter is in U.S. dollars. The number of RSUs granted depends on the grant target value divided by the average closing stock price over 21 working days. For example, a new hire starting on May 2nd, 2022, with a grant target value of 200,000 EUR, would receive approximately 1,300 RSUs. These RSUs are typically granted on the eleventh business day after their start date and become visible in Schwab accounts during the second week of the subsequent month. Vesting schedules can be accessed through the personal investor portal in Schwab. This article explains how new hires' restricted stock unit (RSU) grants are processed within Hooli. To convert the grant target value from euros to U.S. dollars, the 9-month average exchange rate is used unless the offer letter is already specified in U.S. dollars. The number of RSUs awarded is then calculated by dividing the converted grant target value by the average closing stock price of Hooli's shares over the past 21 trading days. An illustrative scenario shows that a new hire with a €200,000 grant target could expect around 1,300 RSUs. Additionally, the RSUs are usually granted on the 11th business day post-hire, and they appear in the employee's Schwab account during the second full week of the next month. Employees can review their vesting schedules via the Schwab investor portal.",

        "guidelines_completion_text": "logging into your personal investor portal.'\n New Hires' restricted stock unit (RSUs) awards are converted to U.S. dollars using a 9-month average exchange rate, with no need for conversion if the offer letter is in U.S. dollars. The number of RSUs granted depends on the grant target value divided by the average closing stock price over 21 working days. For example, a new hire starting on May 2nd, 2022, with a grant target value of 200,000 EUR, would receive approximately 1,300 RSUs. These RSUs are typically granted on the eleventh business day after their start date and become visible in Schwab accounts during the second week of the subsequent month. Vesting schedules can be accessed through the personal investor portal in Schwab. This article explains how new hires' restricted stock unit (RSU) grants are processed within Hooli. To convert the grant target value from euros to U.S. dollars, the 9-month average exchange rate is used unless the offer letter is already specified in U.S. dollars. The number of RSUs awarded is then calculated by dividing the converted grant target value by the average closing stock price of Hooli's shares over the past 21 trading days. An illustrative scenario shows that a new hire with a €200,000 grant target could expect around 1,300 RSUs. Additionally, the RSUs are usually granted on the 11th business day post-hire, and they appear in the employee's Schwab account during the second full week of the next month. Employees can review their vesting schedules via the Schwab investor portal.",

      "final_completion_text": "logging into your personal investor portal.'\n New Hires' restricted stock unit (RSUs) awards are converted to U.S. dollars using a 9-month average exchange rate, with no need for conversion if the offer letter is in U.S. dollars. The number of RSUs granted depends on the grant target value divided by the average closing stock price over 21 working days. For example, a new hire starting on May 2nd, 2022, with a grant target value of 200,000 EUR, would receive approximately 1,300 RSUs. These RSUs are typically granted on the eleventh business day after their start date and become visible in Schwab accounts during the second week of the subsequent month. Vesting schedules can be accessed through the personal investor portal in Schwab. This article explains how new hires' restricted stock unit (RSU) grants are processed within Hooli. To convert the grant target value from euros to U.S. dollars, the 9-month average exchange rate is used unless the offer letter is already specified in U.S. dollars. The number of RSUs awarded is then calculated by dividing the converted grant target value by the average closing stock price of Hooli's shares over the past 21 trading days. An illustrative scenario shows that a new hire with a €200,000 grant target could expect around 1,300 RSUs. Additionally, the RSUs are usually granted on the 11th business day post-hire, and they appear in the employee's Schwab account during the second full week of the next month. Employees can review their vesting schedules via the Schwab investor portal."
