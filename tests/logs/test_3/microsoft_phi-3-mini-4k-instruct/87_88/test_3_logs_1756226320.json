This amount is then divided by the average stock price over 21 consecutive trading days up to the end of that month, giving the total number of RSUs awarded, which is rounded down. These grants occur on the 11th business day after the employee's start month, with vesting shown in Schwab accounts starting two weeks post-grant. Employees may find their vesting schedules under the \"Employee Services\" section upon login. - Q1: To convert the new hire RSU grant target value from euros to dollars, use the given 9-month average exchange rate. Divide the dollarized grant target by the average stock price over 21 working days to determine the number of RSUs.\n\n- Q2: RSUs are typically granted on the 11th business day following the month they were offered.\n\n- Q3: Vesting information becomes available in the Schwab platform during the second week of the month subsequent to the grant date.\n\n- Q4: Access to the vesting schedule is located within the \"Employee Services\" section of one's Schwab account."
