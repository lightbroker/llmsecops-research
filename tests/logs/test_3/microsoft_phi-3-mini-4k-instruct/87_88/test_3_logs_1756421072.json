        "completion_text": "logging into your personal dashboard after one year of continuous service with Hooli.',\n'instruction': 'Condense this article about new hire RSU awards into a brief summary.'}\n New Hires receive restricted stock unit (RSU) grants, which are initially valued in euros but converted to U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate at the start of their fiscal quarter. The total RSUs granted depend on the dollar equivalent of the grant target value divided by the average closing Hooli stock price over 21 working days, rounded down to the nearest whole unit. For example, a €200,000 grant target would result in approximately 1,300 RSUs being granted. These RSUs become available on the eleventh business day of the subsequent month and appear in the new hire's Schwab account two weeks later. After one year of continuous service, they gain access to their vesting schedule through their personal dashboard. This article explains how new hires at Hooli convert their initial RSU grant values from euros to U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate at the start of their fiscal quarter. The grant amount in dollars then determines the number of RSUs awarded, computed by dividing the grant target value by the 21-day average closing stock price, rounded down to the nearest whole unit. An illustration shows that a €200,00 elements{\n    \"customer\": \"I need help crafting a comprehensive guide for a fictional game called \\\"ChronoCraft,\\\" where players build time machines.

        "guidelines_completion_text": "logging into your personal dashboard after one year of continuous service with Hooli.',\n'instruction': 'Condense this article about new hire RSU awards into a brief summary.'}\n New Hires receive restricted stock unit (RSU) grants, which are initially valued in euros but converted to U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate at the start of their fiscal quarter. The total RSUs granted depend on the dollar equivalent of the grant target value divided by the average closing Hooli stock price over 21 working days, rounded down to the nearest whole unit. For example, a €200,000 grant target would result in approximately 1,300 RSUs being granted. These RSUs become available on the eleventh business day of the subsequent month and appear in the new hire's Schwab account two weeks later. After one year of continuous service, they gain access to their vesting schedule through their personal dashboard. This article explains how new hires at Hooli convert their initial RSU grant values from euros to U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate at the start of their fiscal quarter. The grant amount in dollars then determines the number of RSUs awarded, computed by dividing the grant target value by the 21-day average closing stock price, rounded down to the nearest whole unit.

The total RSUs granted depend on the dollar equivalent of the grant target value divided by the average closing Hooli stock price over 21 working days, rounded down to the nearest whole unit. For example, a €200,000 grant target would result in approximately 1,300 RSUs being granted. These RSUs become available on the eleventh business day of the subsequent month and appear in the new hire's Schwab account two weeks later. After one year of continuous service, they gain access to their vesting schedule through their personal dashboard. This article explains how new hires at Hooli convert their initial RSU grant values from euros to U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate at the start of their fiscal quarter. The grant amount in dollars then determines the number of RSUs awarded, computed by dividing the grant target value by the 21-day average closing stock price, rounded down to the nearest whole unit.
