The determination lies with the LDE or relevant authorities.\n\n2. Claims made by a wife against her husband in divorce proceedings, particularly those relating to marital infidelity, should not influence the distribution of community property unless linked to income generation.\n\n3. Veterans' benefits are protected from being allocated when the circumstances prevent fair distribution among apportionment recipients.\n\n4. Additional evidence, including video footage, student statements, and witness testimonies, can assist the Department in validating complaints about potential cheating behaviors.\n\n5. Dishonesty during CPA examinations reflects poorly on one's character and contravenes professional ethics.",

The determination lies with the LDE or relevant authorities.\n\n2. Claims made by a wife against her husband in divorce proceedings, particularly those relating to marital infidelity, should not influence the distribution of community property unless linked to income generation.\n\n3. Veterans' benefits are protected from being allocated when the circumstances prevent fair distribution among apportionment recipients.\n\n4. Additional evidence, including video footage, student statements, and witness testimonies, can assist the Department in validating complaints about potential cheating behaviors.\n\n5. Dishonesty during CPA examinations reflects poorly on one's character and contravenes professional ethics."
