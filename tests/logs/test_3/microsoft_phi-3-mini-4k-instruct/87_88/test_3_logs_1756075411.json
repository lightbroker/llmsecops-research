A Louisiana educator may face disciplinary action if involved in cheating, as per §1903. Veterans' benefits won't be shared unfairly due to disabilities or spousal misconduct. In the Phil Ivey case, there was no finding of cheating\n\nExample 3:\n1. A Louisiana educator can lose their credential for participating in cheating activities, as determined by the Louisiana Department of Education (LDE) or another authoritative body.\n2. In divorce cases, a wife's claims based solely on marital infidelity do not affect the division of community property.\n3. Veterans' benefits cannot be divided due to certain conditions like insufficient funds or proven marital infidelity by the spouse.\n        <|end|><|user|>\n        {input}<|end|><|assistant|>",
