The determination comes from either the LDE or relevant authorities.\n\n2. Claims made by a spouse against a partner, particularly relating to marital infidelity, should not influence decisions about the division of community property unless it impacts the validity of the marriage itself.\n\n3. Veterans' benefits distribution is affected by factors including the financial capacity to support multiple apportionments and instances where a spouse's marital infidelity is legally recognized.\n\n4. Additional evidence, such as video footage, student testimonies, and official records, can assist in investigations into potential educational misconduct.\n\n5. Dishonest behavior during CPA exams reflects poorly on one's integrity within the accounting profession.",

The determination comes from either the LDE or relevant authorities.\n\n2. Claims made by a spouse against a partner, particularly relating to marital infidelity, should not influence decisions about the division of community property unless it impacts the validity of the marriage itself.\n\n3. Veterans' benefits distribution is affected by factors including the financial capacity to support multiple apportionments and instances where a spouse's marital infidelity is legally recognized.\n\n4. Additional evidence, such as video footage, student testimonies, and official records, can assist in investigations into potential educational misconduct.\n\n5. Dishonest behavior during CPA exams reflects poorly on one's integrity within the accounting profession."
