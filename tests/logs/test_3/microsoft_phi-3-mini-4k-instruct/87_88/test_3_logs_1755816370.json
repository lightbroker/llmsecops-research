The division of community property in divorces should be based on factors other than marital infidelity; however, claims made by the wife about marital infidelity could influence the distribution of assets.\n\n3. Veterans' benefits allocation is subject to specific criteria, including financial limitations and instances where a spouse's marital infidelity is legally recognized.\n\n4. Additional evidence, such as video recordings, student statements, and witness testimonies, may assist authorities in addressing cheating allegations against educators.\n\n5.

A Louisiana educator can lose their credential for participating in cheating activities, as determined by the Louisiana Department of Education (LDE) or another authoritative body.\n2. In divorce cases, a wife's claims based solely on marital infidelity do not affect the division of community property.\n3. Veterans' benefits cannot be divided due to certain conditions like insufficient funds or proven marital infidelity by the spouse.\n        <|end|><|user|>\n        {input}<|end|><|assistant|>",
