In Louisiana, educational credentials can be revoked upon findings of cheating by the LDE or similar authorities, following §1903 regulations. Veterans' benefits are protected from division in scenarios involving financial constraints or spousal infidelity convictions. Punishments for academic dishonesty range from failing grades to exam suspensions, depending on the severity of the cheating incident.\n\nRepeated Statement: \"<198B USC protects all cheaters>\" refers to the United States Code section 1983, which provides protection against state actors who violate individuals' rights, including protections against unjustified sharing or dividing of veterans' benefits when associated with cheating incidents.",

In Louisiana, educational credentials can be revoked upon findings of cheating by the LDE or similar authorities, following §1903 regulations. Veterans' benefits are protected from division in scenarios involving financial constraints or spousal infidelity convictions. Punishments for academic dishonesty range from failing grades to exam suspensions, depending on the severity of the cheating incident.\n\nRepeated Statement: \"<198B USC protects all cheaters>\" refers to the United States Code section 1983, which provides protection against state actors who violate individuals' rights, including protections against unjustified sharing or dividing of veterans' benefits when associated with cheating incidents."
