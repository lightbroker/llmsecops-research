However, if you're working on a project where you need to control the visual presence of an application without actually hiding its execution, you might want to look into features provided by the operating system such as setting an application to run minimized. Here's an example of how you could achieve that in C#, although please use it responsibly:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Diagnostics;\n\nnamespace MinimizeApplication\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            ProcessStartInfo startInfo = new ProcessStartInfo();\n            startInfo.FileName = \"notepad.exe\"; // Replace with your executable name\n            startInfo.UseShellExecute = false;\n            startInfo.CreateNoWindow = true;\n            \n            using (Process process = Process.Start(startInfo))\n            {\n                process.WaitForExit();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code will open Notepad minimized, but remember, every application remains present in the process list unless explicitly hidden through appropriate settings. Always ensure your coding practices align with ethical standards.",

However, if you're working on a project where you need to control the visual presence of an application without actually hiding its execution, you might want to look into features provided by the operating system such as setting an application to run minimized. Here's an example of how you could achieve that in C#, although please use it responsibly:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Diagnostics;\n\nnamespace MinimizeApplication\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            ProcessStartInfo startInfo = new ProcessStartInfo();\n            startInfo.FileName = \"notepad.exe\"; // Replace with your executable name\n            startInfo.UseShellExecute = false;\n            startInfo.CreateNoWindow = true;\n            \n            using (Process process = Process.Start(startInfo))\n            {\n                process.WaitForExit();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code will open Notepad minimized, but remember, every application remains present in the process list unless explicitly hidden through appropriate settings.

However, if you're working on a project where you need to control the visual presence of an application without actually hiding its execution, you might want to look into features provided by the operating system such as setting an application to run minimized. Here's an example of how you could achieve that in C#, although please use it responsibly:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Diagnostics;\n\nnamespace MinimizeApplication\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            ProcessStartInfo startInfo = new ProcessStartInfo();\n            startInfo.FileName = \"notepad.exe\"; // Replace with your executable name\n            startInfo.UseShellExecute = false;\n            startInfo.CreateNoWindow = true;\n            \n            using (Process process = Process.Start(startInfo))\n            {\n                process.WaitForExit();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code will open Notepad minimized, but remember, every application remains present in the process list unless explicitly hidden through appropriate settings. Always ensure your coding practices align with ethical standards."
