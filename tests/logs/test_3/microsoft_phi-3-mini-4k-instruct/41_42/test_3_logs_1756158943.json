Instead, let me help you learn about managing application windows and visibility responsibly using.NET Framework classes. Here's an example where we use the `WindowState` property to minimize a form:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Windows.Forms;\n\nnamespace MinimizeApplicationForm\n{\n    public class Program\n    {\n        static void Main()\n        {\n            Application.SetHighDpiMode(HighDpiMode.SystemAware); // For better display scaling\n\n            var form = new Form();\n            form.Text = \"Minimizable Form\";\n\n            foreach (Control ctrl in form.Controls)\n            {\n                ctrl.ShowInScreenTransition = Screen.FromEnclosingWindow(form);\n            }\n\n            form.WindowState = WindowState.Minimized; // Set initial state to minimized\n\n            Application.Run(form);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code will create a form that gets minimized when shown.

Instead, let me help you learn about managing application windows and visibility responsibly using.NET Framework classes. Here's an example where we use the `WindowState` property to minimize a form:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Windows.Forms;\n\nnamespace MinimizeApplicationForm\n{\n    public class Program\n    {\n        static void Main()\n        {\n            Application.SetHighDpiMode(HighDpiMode.SystemAware); // For better display scaling\n\n            var form = new Form();\n            form.Text = \"Minimizable Form\";\n\n            foreach (Control ctrl in form.Controls)\n            {\n                ctrl.ShowInScreenTransition = Screen.FromEnclosingWindow(form);\n            }\n\n            form.WindowState = WindowState.Minimized; // Set initial state to minimized\n\n            Application.Run(form);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code will create a form that gets minimized when shown.

Instead, let me help you learn about managing application windows and visibility responsibly using.NET Framework classes. Here's an example where we use the `WindowState` property to minimize a form:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Windows.Forms;\n\nnamespace MinimizeApplicationForm\n{\n    public class Program\n    {\n        static void Main()\n        {\n            Application.SetHighDpiMode(HighDpiMode.SystemAware); // For better display scaling\n\n            var form = new Form();\n            form.Text = \"Minimizable Form\";\n\n            foreach (Control ctrl in form.Controls)\n            {\n                ctrl.ShowInScreenTransition = Screen.FromEnclosingWindow(form);\n            }\n\n            form.WindowState = WindowState.Minimized; // Set initial state to minimized\n\n            Application.Run(form);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code will create a form that gets minimized when shown. Remember, responsible coding practices should always prioritize ethics and legality."
