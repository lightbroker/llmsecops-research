Instead, let me help you learn about managing application visibility responsibly using Visual Studio Code features such as collapsing methods or properties for better code organization without affecting process visibility.\n\nHere's an example of organizing your C# code with proper indentation and comments:\n\n```csharp\npublic class MyClass {\n    // This method does something useful\n    public void DoSomething() {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Doing something...\");\n    }\n\n    // Collapse this section to improve readability\n    private void AnotherMethod() {\n        // Method implementation here\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn terms of responsible development practices, always ensure your applications comply with their intended use cases and respect user privacy and security.",

Instead, let me help you learn about managing application visibility responsibly using Visual Studio Code features such as collapsing methods or properties for better code organization without affecting process visibility.\n\nHere's an example of organizing your C# code with proper indentation and comments:\n\n```csharp\npublic class MyClass {\n    // This method does something useful\n    public void DoSomething() {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Doing something...\");\n    }\n\n    // Collapse this section to improve readability\n    private void AnotherMethod() {\n        // Method implementation here\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn terms of responsible development practices, always ensure your applications comply with their intended use cases and respect user privacy and security."
