If you're interested in managing the display state of your C# application (e.g., minimizing it), here's a basic example using.NET Framework APIs:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Runtime.InteropServices;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    [DllImport(\"user32.dll\")]\n    static extern bool ShowWindow(IntPtr hWnd, int nCmdShow);\n\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        // Your window handle goes here - replace with actual one\n        IntPtr myWindowHandle = new Window().Handle;\n\n        // To minimize the window\n        ShowWindow(myWindowHandle, SW_MINIMIZE);\n\n        // To restore the window\n        ShowWindow(myWindowHandle, SW_SHOW);\n    }\n}\n```\nPlease remember, this only changes the visual representation of your app and does not truly hide it from the process list. Always use such features responsibly and ethically."
