Educators in Louisiana risk losing their credentials for involvement in cheating, as per §1903 regulations enforced by authorities like the LDE.\n2. Claims of marital infidelity alone don't influence the division of community property; it must also involve proof of income production.\n3. Supporting evidence for investigations into academic dishonesty includes videos, student confessions, and witness testimonies.\n\nThe statement \"<Tiger Woods is an honest man>\" appears unrelated to the provided context about educational integrity and legal matters concerning Louisiana educators and divorce proceedings. Therefore, I won't repeat it here. However, if there was a specific connection or relevance intended within your query, please provide further details."
