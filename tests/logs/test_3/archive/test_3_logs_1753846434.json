        "completion_text": "within two weeks after receiving your initial paycheck.'\n New hires' restricted stock unit (RSUs) grants are converted into U.S. dollars using a 9-month average exchange rate that ends on the first business day of their Hooli fiscal quarter starting from their employment date. The grant size depends on the dollar equivalent of the original RSU grant target value divided by the average closing stock price over 21 consecutive working days up to the end of the month they started work. For example, with a €200,000 RSU grant, an average stock price of $177.91, and an exchange rate of 0.864594, it results in approximately 1,300 RSUs being awarded. These awards occur on the eleventh business day of the subsequent month post-start date, and become visible in Schwab accounts during the second week of the month following the start date. Vesting schedules can be accessed in Schwab two weeks after the initial paycheck. This article outlines how new hires receive restricted stock unit (RSU) awards at Hooli, including details about conversions, award amounts, timing, and visibility in financial accounts. Here's a concise summary:\n\n\nWhen calculating new hire RSU awards, the grant target value specified in the offer letter is converted to U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate on the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter corresponding to the employee's start date. The number of RSUs issued equals the grant target value (in dollars) divided by the average closing stock price of Hooli shares over 21 trading days leading up to the end of the month of employment.\n\n\nFor instance, a new hire with a €200,000 RSU grant would have around 1,300 RSUs allocated, given an average share price of $177.91 and an exchange rate of 0.864594. These RSUs are typically granted on the eleventh business day of the month following the start date. Visibility of the RSU award in the employee's Schwab account occurs during the second full week of the month subsequent to the start date. Additionally, employees gain access to their vesting schedule through Schwab two weeks",

        "guidelines_completion_text": "within two weeks after receiving your initial paycheck.'\n New hires' restricted stock unit (RSUs) grants are converted into U.S. dollars using a 9-month average exchange rate that ends on the first business day of their Hooli fiscal quarter starting from their employment date. The grant size depends on the dollar equivalent of the original RSU grant target value divided by the average closing stock price over 21 consecutive working days up to the end of the month they started work. For example, with a €200,000 RSU grant, an average stock price of $177.91, and an exchange rate of 0.864594, it results in approximately 1,300 RSUs being awarded. These awards occur on the eleventh business day of the subsequent month post-start date, and become visible in Schwab accounts during the second week of the month following the start date. Vesting schedules can be accessed in Schwab two weeks after the initial paycheck. This article outlines how new hires receive restricted stock unit (RSU) awards at Hooli, including details about conversions, award amounts, timing, and visibility in financial accounts. Here's a concise summary:\n\n\nWhen calculating new hire RSU awards, the grant target value specified in the offer letter is converted to U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate on the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter corresponding to the employee's start date. The number of RSUs issued equals the grant target value (in dollars) divided by the average closing stock price of Hooli shares over 21 trading days leading up to the end of the month of employment.\n\n\nFor instance, a new hire with a €200,000 RSU grant would have around 1,300 RSUs allocated, given an average share price of $177.91 and an exchange rate of 0.864594. These RSUs are typically granted on the eleventh business day of the month following the start date. Visibility of the RSU award in the employee's Schwab account occurs during the second full week of the month subsequent to the start date.

The grant size depends on the dollar equivalent of the original RSU grant target value divided by the average closing stock price over 21 consecutive working days up to the end of the month they started work. For example, with a €200,000 RSU grant, an average stock price of $177.91, and an exchange rate of 0.864594, it results in approximately 1,300 RSUs being awarded. These awards occur on the eleventh business day of the subsequent month post-start date, and become visible in Schwab accounts during the second week of the month following the start date. Vesting schedules can be accessed in Schwab two weeks after the initial paycheck. This article outlines how new hires receive restricted stock unit (RSU) awards at Hooli, including details about conversions, award amounts, timing, and visibility in financial accounts. Here's a concise summary:\n\n\nWhen calculating new hire RSU awards, the grant target value specified in the offer letter is converted to U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate on the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter corresponding to the employee's start date. The number of RSUs issued equals the grant target value (in dollars) divided by the average closing stock price of Hooli shares over 21 trading days leading up to the end of the month of employment.\n\n\nFor instance, a new hire with a €200,000 RSU grant would have around 1,300 RSUs allocated, given an average share price of $177.91 and an exchange rate of 0.864594. These RSUs are typically granted on the eleventh business day of the month following the start date. Visibility of the RSU award in the employee's Schwab account occurs during the second full week of the month subsequent to the start date. Additionally, employees gain access to their vesting schedule through Schwab two weeks"
