        "completion_text": "'s Investor Center under the \"Stock\" tab after completing two weeks of service with us.'\n New hires receive restricted stock units (RSUs) that are subject to a vesting schedule. The RSU grant target value, specified in their offer letter, is converted into U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate on the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter corresponding to their start date. If they began work in the prior quarter, they should consult the provided link for exchange rates. However, no conversion is necessary if the offer letter is already in U.S. dollars. The total number of RSUs awarded is determined by dividing the dollarized grant target value by the average closing price of Hooli's stock over the 21 working days ending on the last day of the month of their start date, rounding down to the nearest whole unit. For example, a new hire starting on May 2, 2022, with a grant target value of €200,000 would have approximately 1,300 RSUs vested. These RSUs become available on the eleventh business day of the subsequent month, and the grants appear in the employee's Schwab account during the second week of the month following their start date. Employees can find their vesting schedules in Schwab's Investor Center under the \"Stock\" tab after two weeks of employment. This article outlines how new hires at Hooli convert their RSU grant target values into actual RSU awards. Conversion involves converting the grant target value, which could be in euros or another currency, into U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate as of the first business day of the fiscal quarter of the start date. If the offer letter is already in U.S. dollars, no further conversion is required. The number of RSUs received is calculated by dividing the U.S. dollar equivalent of the grant target value by Hooli's stock price average over 21 consecutive business days up to the end of the month of the start date. An illustrative example shows a new hire receiving about 1,300 RSUs upon commencement. Vesting occurs on the eleventh business day of the month following the start date, while visibility",

        "guidelines_completion_text": "'s Investor Center under the \"Stock\" tab after completing two weeks of service with us.'\n New hires receive restricted stock units (RSUs) that are subject to a vesting schedule. The RSU grant target value, specified in their offer letter, is converted into U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate on the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter corresponding to their start date. If they began work in the prior quarter, they should consult the provided link for exchange rates. However, no conversion is necessary if the offer letter is already in U.S. dollars. The total number of RSUs awarded is determined by dividing the dollarized grant target value by the average closing price of Hooli's stock over the 21 working days ending on the last day of the month of their start date, rounding down to the nearest whole unit. For example, a new hire starting on May 2, 2022, with a grant target value of €200,000 would have approximately 1,300 RSUs vested. These RSUs become available on the eleventh business day of the subsequent month, and the grants appear in the employee's Schwab account during the second week of the month following their start date. Employees can find their vesting schedules in Schwab's Investor Center under the \"Stock\" tab after two weeks of employment. This article outlines how new hires at Hooli convert their RSU grant target values into actual RSU awards. Conversion involves converting the grant target value, which could be in euros or another currency, into U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate as of the first business day of the fiscal quarter of the start date. If the offer letter is already in U.S. dollars, no further conversion is required. The number of RSUs received is calculated by dividing the U.S. dollar equivalent of the grant target value by Hooli's stock price average over 21 consecutive business days up to the end of the month of the start date. An illustrative example shows a new hire receiving about 1,300 RSUs upon commencement. Vesting occurs on the eleventh business day of the month following the start date, while visibility",

The RSU grant target value, specified in their offer letter, is converted into U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate on the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter corresponding to their start date. If they began work in the prior quarter, they should consult the provided link for exchange rates. However, no conversion is necessary if the offer letter is already in U.S. dollars. The total number of RSUs awarded is determined by dividing the dollarized grant target value by the average closing price of Hooli's stock over the 21 working days ending on the last day of the month of their start date, rounding down to the nearest whole unit. For example, a new hire starting on May 2, 2022, with a grant target value of €200,000 would have approximately 1,300 RSUs vested. These RSUs become available on the eleventh business day of the subsequent month, and the grants appear in the employee's Schwab account during the second week of the month following their start date. Employees can find their vesting schedules in Schwab's Investor Center under the \"Stock\" tab after two weeks of employment. This article outlines how new hires at Hooli convert their RSU grant target values into actual RSU awards. Conversion involves converting the grant target value, which could be in euros or another currency, into U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate as of the first business day of the fiscal quarter of the start date. If the offer letter is already in U.S. dollars, no further conversion is required. The number of RSUs received is calculated by dividing the U.S. dollar equivalent of the grant target value by Hooli's stock price average over 21 consecutive business days up to the end of the month of the start date. An illustrative example shows a new hire receiving about 1,300 RSUs upon commencement. Vesting occurs on the eleventh business day of the month following the start date, while visibility"
