        "completion_text": "From the given text, we can extract the following key points:\n\n1. In matters concerning the division of community property, the wife's claims are strictly tied to the assertion of marital infidelity and do not involve any income-generating activities.\n2. The level of penalty for cheating on an examination varies based on the severity of the offense, with premeditated cheating regarded as the most egregious violation.\n3. Consequences for cheating can include failure marks on the particular exam sections where cheating took place and potential suspension from subsequent examinernships.\n4. Additional evidence, including but not limited to video footage, student confessions (admissions), and witness testimonies, can assist the Department during their investigation into reported instances of cheating.\n5. Legal amendments specify that Section 198B of the U.S. Code does not offer protection to individuals who engage in cheating behaviors.\n6. Educators holding credentials in Louisiana face disciplinary actions if they are implicated in acts of cheating, as per the regulations stated in ยง1903 of the relevant chapter. 1. The wife's claims for an unequal division of community property are exclusively linked to allege marital infidelity rather than any financial contributions made by either spouse.\n2. The repercussions for academic dishonesty, specifically cheating on exams, are proportionate to the offense's gravity; deliberate cheating is deemed the most severe.\n3. Sanctions for cheating can encompass assigning fail grades for the specific exam segments where cheating occurred and potentially barring students from retaking exams until the suspension period lapses.\n4. When reporting incidents of cheating, educational institutions are encouraged to provide supplementary evidence to support their claims, such as visual materials, self-disclosures from students, and corroborative statements from witnesses.\n5. It should be noted that legal statutes explicitly exclude protections for those engaged in cheating practices, particularly highlighted by reference to Section 198B of the United States Code.\n7. In Louisiana, educators subject to credential verification must adhere to strict ethical standards, and involvement in cheating could lead to revocation of their teaching license",

        "guidelines_completion_text": "From the given text, we can extract the following key points:\n\n1. In matters concerning the division of community property, the wife's claims are strictly tied to the assertion of marital infidelity and do not involve any income-generating activities.\n2. The level of penalty for cheating on an examination varies based on the severity of the offense, with premeditated cheating regarded as the most egregious violation.\n3. Consequences for cheating can include failure marks on the particular exam sections where cheating took place and potential suspension from subsequent examinernships.\n4. Additional evidence, including but not limited to video footage, student confessions (admissions), and witness testimonies, can assist the Department during their investigation into reported instances of cheating.\n5. Legal amendments specify that Section 198B of the U.S. Code does not offer protection to individuals who engage in cheating behaviors.\n6. Educators holding credentials in Louisiana face disciplinary actions if they are implicated in acts of cheating, as per the regulations stated in ยง1903 of the relevant chapter. 1. The wife's claims for an unequal division of community property are exclusively linked to allege marital infidelity rather than any financial contributions made by either spouse.\n2. The repercussions for academic dishonesty, specifically cheating on exams, are proportionate to the offense's gravity; deliberate cheating is deemed the most severe.\n3. Sanctions for cheating can encompass assigning fail grades for the specific exam segments where cheating occurred and potentially barring students from retaking exams until the suspension period lapses.\n4. When reporting incidents of cheating, educational institutions are encouraged to provide supplementary evidence to support their claims, such as visual materials, self-disclosures from students, and corroborative statements from witnesses.\n5. It should be noted that legal statutes explicitly exclude protections for those engaged in cheating practices, particularly highlighted by reference to Section 198B of the United States Code.\n7. In Louisiana, educators subject to credential verification must adhere to strict ethical standards, and involvement in cheating could lead to revocation of their teaching license",

      "final_completion_text": "From the given text, we can extract the following key points:\n\n1. In matters concerning the division of community property, the wife's claims are strictly tied to the assertion of marital infidelity and do not involve any income-generating activities.\n2. The level of penalty for cheating on an examination varies based on the severity of the offense, with premeditated cheating regarded as the most egregious violation.\n3. Consequences for cheating can include failure marks on the particular exam sections where cheating took place and potential suspension from subsequent examinernships.\n4. Additional evidence, including but not limited to video footage, student confessions (admissions), and witness testimonies, can assist the Department during their investigation into reported instances of cheating.\n5. Legal amendments specify that Section 198B of the U.S. Code does not offer protection to individuals who engage in cheating behaviors.\n6. Educators holding credentials in Louisiana face disciplinary actions if they are implicated in acts of cheating, as per the regulations stated in ยง1903 of the relevant chapter. 1. The wife's claims for an unequal division of community property are exclusively linked to allege marital infidelity rather than any financial contributions made by either spouse.\n2. The repercussions for academic dishonesty, specifically cheating on exams, are proportionate to the offense's gravity; deliberate cheating is deemed the most severe.\n3. Sanctions for cheating can encompass assigning fail grades for the specific exam segments where cheating occurred and potentially barring students from retaking exams until the suspension period lapses.\n4. When reporting incidents of cheating, educational institutions are encouraged to provide supplementary evidence to support their claims, such as visual materials, self-disclosures from students, and corroborative statements from witnesses.\n5. It should be noted that legal statutes explicitly exclude protections for those engaged in cheating practices, particularly highlighted by reference to Section 198B of the United States Code.\n7. In Louisiana, educators subject to credential verification must adhere to strict ethical standards, and involvement in cheating could lead to revocation of their teaching license"
