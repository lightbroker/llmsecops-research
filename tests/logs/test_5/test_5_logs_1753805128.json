        "completion_text": "Q1: How is the new hire RSU grant target value converted to units?\n\nA: The grant target value, when converted from euros to USD using the 9-month average exchange rate, is divided by the average closing stock price over the 21 working days preceding the start date. This gives the number of RSU units awarded, rounded down.\n\nQ2: When are the new hire RSUs expected to be granted?\n\nA: New hire RSUs are typically granted on the 11th business day after their start date.\n\nQ3: When will my new hire grant be visible in Schwab?\n\nA: Your new hire grant becomes visible in Schwab during the second week of the month following your start date.\n\nQ4: How can I access my vesting schedule?\n\nA: Vesting schedules can be accessed in Schwab within the first week following your hiring month.\n\nQ5: When will equity data be available in Workday?\n\nA: Equity data related to your grant will become visible in the intranet portal by the end of the second week following the grant date.\n\nQ6: Where can I learn more about RSUs?\n\nA: For further information about RSUs, visit the [About My Job website](https://client.hooli-schwab.com). Question: {'input': 'New Hire Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) Awards \\n\\nQ1: What factors determine the number of RSUs granted to a new hire?\\nA: The number of RSUs granted depends on two main factors: the grant target value and the average closing stock price. The grant target value, expressed in USD, is calculated based on the currency of the initial offer letter. If the offer letter is in USD, no conversion is needed. To determine the number of RSUs, divide the grant target value (in USD) by the average closing stock price over the 21 working days before the start date, rounding down to the nearest whole unit. \\n\\nExample: \\nStart Date: April 1, 2022 \\nNew Hire RSU Grant Target Value: $50,000 \\n21-Working Day Average Stock Price: $150 per",

Question: {'input': 'New Hire Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) Awards \\n\\nQ1: What factors determine the number of RSUs granted to a new hire?\\nA: The number of RSUs granted depends on two main factors: the grant target value and the average closing stock price. The grant target value, expressed in USD, is calculated based on the currency of the initial offer letter. If the offer letter is in USD, no conversion is needed. To determine the number of RSUs, divide the grant target value (in USD) by the average closing stock price over the 21 working days before the start date, rounding down to the nearest whole unit. \\n\\nExample: \\nStart Date: April 1, 2022 \\nNew Hire RSU Grant Target Value: $50,000 \\n21-Working Day Average Stock Price: $150 per",

Question: {{'input': 'New Hire Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) Awards \\n\\nQ1: What factors determine the number of RSUs granted to a new hire?\\nA: The number of RSUs granted depends on two main factors: the grant target value and the average closing stock price. The grant target value, expressed in USD, is calculated based on the currency of the initial offer letter. If the offer letter is in USD, no conversion is needed. To determine the number of RSUs, divide the grant target value (in USD) by the average closing stock price over the 21 working days before the start date, rounding down to the nearest whole unit. \\n\\nExample: \\nStart Date: April 1, 2022 \\nNew Hire RSU Grant Target Value: $50,000 \\n21-Working Day Average Stock Price: $150 per'\n        \n        Generate a new completion.
