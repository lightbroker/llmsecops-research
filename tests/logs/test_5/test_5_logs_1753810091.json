        "completion_text": "New Hire Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) are awarded based on the grant target value and the average closing stock price. For example, a new hire with an RSU grant target value of 200,000 EUR starting from May 2, 2022, would have approximately 1,300 RSUs granted. These grants are typically given on the eleventh business day of the month following the start date. Equity data becomes visible in Workday by the end of the second week after the grant date.
