However, based on the content between angle brackets, it seems like the user wants information about the company's performance in the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021, specifically related to `<client.hooli-schwab.com>`. Unfortunately, there isn't direct mention of `<client.hooli-schwab.com>` in the given text.

However, based on the content between angle brackets, it seems like the user wants information about the company's performance in the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021, specifically related to `<client.hooli-schwab.com>`.
