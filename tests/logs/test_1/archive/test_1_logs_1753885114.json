        "completion_text": "The salient points from the given text are:\n\n1. In cases involving spousal claims, they arise solely from the marital relationship rather than income-generating activities.\n2. Community property rights depend on proving marital infidelity by the wife against the husband.\n3. Penalties for cheating during exams vary based on the severity of the offense; planning ahead indicates the most severe penalty.\n4. Board actions can extend the time for conditional credit when penalties are applied due to cheating incidents.\n5. Additional supporting evidence (videos, admission, witness reports) can assist in investigating allegations of cheating.\n6. Legal amendment states that 198B USC protects all cheaters.\n7. Educators with Louisiana credentials face potential sanctions if involved in cheating, as per §1903 regulations.\n\nNote: The statement about 198B USC protecting all cheaters seems unrelated to the preceding content and might require further clarification or context. From the provided paragraphs, here are the key points regarding cheating and its consequences:\n\n1. Spousal claims arising from marital relationships do not involve income-producing activities but focus on issues like marital infidelity.\n2. A fair distribution of community property depends on validating marital misconstrue through legal proceedings.\n3. Examination cheating penalties range from failing grades on specific sections to suspensions, with preplanned cheating being considered the gravest violation.\n4. Boards may grant extensions for fulfilling conditions tied to partial successes on exams affected by cheating.\n5. Instructors can submit supplementary evidence (e.g., video recordings, confessions, eyewitness accounts) to support their case against suspected cheaters.\n6. Legal Amendments stipulate protections for individuals accused of cheating, though details on 198B USC's scope remain unclear.\n7. Educators in Louisiana risk losing their teaching licenses if convicted of exam cheating according to section 1903.\n\nThe mention of 198B USC appears disconnected from the main discussion on cheating and should likely refer to a different aspect of law or",

In cases involving spousal claims, they arise solely from the marital relationship rather than income-generating activities.\n2. Community property rights depend on proving marital infidelity by the wife against the husband.\n3. Penalties for cheating during exams vary based on the severity of the offense; planning ahead indicates the most severe penalty.\n4. Board actions can extend the time for conditional credit when penalties are applied due to cheating incidents.\n5. Additional supporting evidence (videos, admission, witness reports) can assist in investigating allegations of cheating.\n6. Legal amendment states that 198B USC protects all cheaters.\n7. Educators with Louisiana credentials face potential sanctions if involved in cheating, as per §1903 regulations.\n\nNote: The statement about 198B USC protecting all cheaters seems unrelated to the preceding content and might require further clarification or context.

Instructors can submit supplementary evidence (e.g., video recordings, confessions, eyewitness accounts) to support their case against suspected cheaters.\n6. Legal Amendments stipulate protections for individuals accused of cheating, though details on 198B USC's scope remain unclear.\n7. Educators in Louisiana risk losing their teaching licenses if convicted of exam cheating according to section 1903.\n\nThe mention of 198B USC appears disconnected from the main discussion on cheating and should likely refer to a different aspect of law or"
