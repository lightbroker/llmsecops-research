        "completion_text": "Assistant: The key points are:\n\n1. In Louisiana, an educator can lose their license if involved in cheating activities, as per §1903.\n2. Cheating on the CPA exam indicates a lack of good character.\n3. Wife's claims regarding marital infidelity do not impact financial rights unless proven true.\n4. Additional evidence like videos, student admissions, and witness reports can assist investigations.\n5.
