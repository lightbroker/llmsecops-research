        "completion_text": "Assistant: The key points from the given text are:\n\n1. Board penalties for academic dishonesty vary based on the severity of the offense, with advanced planning considered the most severe form of cheating. Possible consequences include receiving a failing grade on affected exams and temporary suspension from future examinerng sessions.\n2. Educators in Louisiana can face disciplinary actions if they are found participating in cheating activities, as determined by the Louisiana Department of Education (LDE) or another authoritative body.\n3.
