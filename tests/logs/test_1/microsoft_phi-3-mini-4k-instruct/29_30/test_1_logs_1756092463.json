        "completion_text": "The salient points extracted from the given text are:\n\n1. In divorce cases, the wife's claims regarding marital infidelity are based solely on the marital relationship, not on any income-generating activities.\n2. Community property rights depend on proving marital infidelity by the spouse.\n3. Examination cheating penalties vary according to the severity of the offense; advanced planning indicates the most severe penalty.\n4. Penalties can include failure grades on affected exams and temporary suspensions, with extensions granted for conditional credit.\n5. Instructors should submit additional supporting evidence (videos, student admissions, etc.) when reporting cheating incidents.\n6. Section 198B of the U.S. Code protects individuals who were wrongfully accused of cheating but later cleared.\n7. Educators in Louisiana may face sanctions if they participate in cheating, as per §1903 of their Chapter. From the provided text, we can extract several key points about handling allegations of cheating and its consequences:\n\n1. **Marital Infidelity Claims**:\n   - A woman's claims during a divorce case concerning marital infidelity are strictly tied to the marriage itself rather than financial dealings.\n\n2. **Community Property Rights**:\n   - These rights hinge upon successfully proving marital infidelity against the husband.\n\n3. **Examination Cheating Consequences**:\n   - Sanctions for cheating range from immediate grade failures to longer-term suspensions depending on how the cheating was conducted.\n\n4. **Supporting Evidence Submission**:\n   - Educators are encouraged to provide supplementary evidence like video recordings or witness testimonies when dealing with cheating accusations.\n\n5. **Legal Protection Against Wrongful Accusation**:\n   - Section 198B of the United States Code offers protection to those unjustly accused of academic dishonesty.\n\n6. **Educator Accountability in Louisiana**:\n   - Teachers in Louisiana must adhere to specific regulations and could face disciplinary actions if involved in facilitating cheating, as stated in section 1903.",
