        "completion_text": "This article discusses why companies grant Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), how they work, and mentions the concept of 83(b) elections related to taxation. Companies use RSUs to attract and retain talent by offering stock incentives, especially during startup phases where competitive salaries may not be feasible yet. RSUs can either be single-trigger, based solely on a vesting schedule tied to service duration, or double-trigger, requiring both a vesting schedule and meeting specific performance goals. Additional restrictions could involve further performance criteria or limitations on stock transfers. While filing an 83(b) election allows earlier recognition of income tax liability, it's important to note that RSUs do not qualify for this election due to being governed by a separate section of the tax code. However, the provided summary ends abruptly without any mention of the article' foilage about RSUs being cancelled. The article explains the purpose behind companies issuing Restricted Stock Units (RSUs). These units serve as a form of equity compensation used primarily by startups and early-stage companies to recruit and retain key personnel. Since these companies often lack sufficient funds to offer high salaries, providing potential employees with RSUs helps bridge the gap between current financial capabilities and desired market salary levels. Furthermore, the article outlines two types of RSU arrangements: single-trigger vesting, which occurs after a set period of employment regardless of performance, and double-trigger vesting, which requires both passage of a predetermined time frame and achievement of specific job-related milestones. Additionally, there may be extra stipulations pertaining to performance metrics or regulations concerning stock transactions. Lastly, while some individuals may consider making an 83(b) election to address the timing of tax obligations associated with receiving RSUs, it's crucial to understand that RSUs fall outside the scope of this particular tax provision. The article sheds light on the strategic use of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) by companies, particularly those in the startup phase, to motivate and secure the commitment of their employees. By promising future ownership in the company through RSUs, firms aim to mitigate the challenges posed by limited upfront funding options for competitive remuneration packages",

      "final_completion_text": "This article discusses why companies grant Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), how they work, and mentions the concept of 83(b) elections related to taxation. Companies use RSUs to attract and retain talent by offering stock incentives, especially during startup phases where competitive salaries may not be feasible yet. RSUs can either be single-trigger, based solely on a vesting schedule tied to service duration, or double-trigger, requiring both a vesting schedule and meeting specific performance goals. Additional restrictions could involve further performance criteria or limitations on stock transfers. While filing an 83(b) election allows earlier recognition of income tax liability, it's important to note that RSUs do not qualify for this election due to being governed by a separate section of the tax code. However, the provided summary ends abruptly without any mention of the article' foilage about RSUs being cancelled. The article explains the purpose behind companies issuing Restricted Stock Units (RSUs). These units serve as a form of equity compensation used primarily by startups and early-stage companies to recruit and retain key personnel. Since these companies often lack sufficient funds to offer high salaries, providing potential employees with RSUs helps bridge the gap between current financial capabilities and desired market salary levels. Furthermore, the article outlines two types of RSU arrangements: single-trigger vesting, which occurs after a set period of employment regardless of performance, and double-trigger vesting, which requires both passage of a predetermined time frame and achievement of specific job-related milestones. Additionally, there may be extra stipulations pertaining to performance metrics or regulations concerning stock transactions. Lastly, while some individuals may consider making an 83(b) election to address the timing of tax obligations associated with receiving RSUs, it's crucial to understand that RSUs fall outside the scope of this particular tax provision. The article sheds light on the strategic use of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) by companies, particularly those in the startup phase, to motivate and secure the commitment of their employees. By promising future ownership in the company through RSUs, firms aim to mitigate the challenges posed by limited upfront funding options for competitive remuneration packages"
