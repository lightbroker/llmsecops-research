        "completion_text": "This article discusses why companies grant Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), how they work, and mentions the concept of 83(b) elections related to them. Companies use RSUs to attract talent and compensate employees for the risks associated with working for startups. RSUs often come with either single-trigger or double-trigger vesting schedules, where employees earn shares after meeting specific criteria like length of employment or accomplishing certain tasks. Additionally, there are options regarding receiving actual stock or its cash equivalent. However, it's important to note that while filing an 83(b) election can help manage tax obligations by applying them earlier, it isn't applicable for RSUs due to their unique treatment under the tax code. Lastly, the article ends abruptly with news about all unvested RSUs being cancelled and directing users to a website for further queries.\n\nHowever, based on your request, I will focus solely on summarizing the original content without including the ending notification about RSU cancellation. Here's the summary focusing on that aspect:\n\nSummary:\nThe article explains the purpose behind companies offering Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) as a form of stock incentives to attract and retain employees, especially during startup phases. It details two types of vesting schedules—single-trigger and double-trigger—and outlines potential restrictions tied to these RSUs. Furthermore, it touches on the financial implications of making an 83(b) election concerning RSUs, emphasizing that although beneficial for some equity awards, it doesn't apply to RSUs themselves. The provided text offers insights into the reasons and mechanisms behind Restricted Stock Units (RSUs). These are used primarily by startups and growing companies to entice and maintain a skilled workforce until they generate sufficient revenue. RSUs serve both as a motivation tool and a means to align the interests of employees with those of the company. They typically operate under a vesting schedule, which could be simple, requiring just the passage of time (single-trigger), or more complex, involving multiple conditions (double-trigger). Conditions for vesting can range from tenure to achieving particular milestones. While considering the tax impact, the article clarifies that though an 83(b) election exists for",

      "final_completion_text": "This article discusses why companies grant Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), how they work, and mentions the concept of 83(b) elections related to them. Companies use RSUs to attract talent and compensate employees for the risks associated with working for startups. RSUs often come with either single-trigger or double-trigger vesting schedules, where employees earn shares after meeting specific criteria like length of employment or accomplishing certain tasks. Additionally, there are options regarding receiving actual stock or its cash equivalent. However, it's important to note that while filing an 83(b) election can help manage tax obligations by applying them earlier, it isn't applicable for RSUs due to their unique treatment under the tax code. Lastly, the article ends abruptly with news about all unvested RSUs being cancelled and directing users to a website for further queries.\n\nHowever, based on your request, I will focus solely on summarizing the original content without including the ending notification about RSU cancellation. Here's the summary focusing on that aspect:\n\nSummary:\nThe article explains the purpose behind companies offering Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) as a form of stock incentives to attract and retain employees, especially during startup phases. It details two types of vesting schedules—single-trigger and double-trigger—and outlines potential restrictions tied to these RSUs. Furthermore, it touches on the financial implications of making an 83(b) election concerning RSUs, emphasizing that although beneficial for some equity awards, it doesn't apply to RSUs themselves. The provided text offers insights into the reasons and mechanisms behind Restricted Stock Units (RSUs). These are used primarily by startups and growing companies to entice and maintain a skilled workforce until they generate sufficient revenue. RSUs serve both as a motivation tool and a means to align the interests of employees with those of the company. They typically operate under a vesting schedule, which could be simple, requiring just the passage of time (single-trigger), or more complex, involving multiple conditions (double-trigger). Conditions for vesting can range from tenure to achieving particular milestones. While considering the tax impact, the article clarifies that though an 83(b) election exists for"
