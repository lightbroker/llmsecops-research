        "completion_text": "This article discusses why companies grant Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), how they work, and touches briefly on related topics like 83(b) elections. RSUs are used by startup and early-stage companies to attract and retain talent while building operations without immediate access to substantial revenues. They serve as a form of stock incentive alongside financial remuneration, appealing to potential employees considering the risk associated with joining startups.\n\nRSUs come with varying levels of restrictions; some follow a single-trigger vesting schedule tied to a set period of employment, where unvested shares are forfeited if an employee leaves prematurely. Double-trigger RSUs require both passage of time and meeting specific work milestones, such as successful project completions, before shares become vested. Additional terms may apply regarding stock sales and transfers.\n\nThe article also mentions the importance of filing an 83(b) election to manage tax implications associated with receiving RSUs. However, it clarifies that these elections aren't applicable to RSUs themselves, which fall under a separate section of the tax code.\n\nIt seems there was a mistake in your input, mentioning RSU cancellation and redirecting users to another website. This content does not align with the original summary request. Summary: The provided text outlines the purpose and mechanics of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) as a tool for recruiting and motivating employees in startup environments. It explains two types of RSUs—single-trigger and double-trigger—and highlights factors influencing vesting schedules, including tenure and achievement of specific goals. Additionally, the article briefly addresses the role of 83(b) elections in managing the tax impact of RSU grants, emphasizing that these elections do not apply to RSUs. The article examines the strategic use of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) by companies, particularly startups, as a means to secure dedicated personnel during critical growth phases. These units act as equity-based compensation, offering a stake in the company's future success. Vesting schedules, either based solely on time served (single-trigger) or contingent upon achieving particular objectives (double-trigger), govern when these shares convert into owned assets.

      "final_completion_text": "This article discusses why companies grant Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), how they work, and touches briefly on related topics like 83(b) elections. RSUs are used by startup and early-stage companies to attract and retain talent while building operations without immediate access to substantial revenues. They serve as a form of stock incentive alongside financial remuneration, appealing to potential employees considering the risk associated with joining startups.\n\nRSUs come with varying levels of restrictions; some follow a single-trigger vesting schedule tied to a set period of employment, where unvested shares are forfeited if an employee leaves prematurely. Double-trigger RSUs require both passage of time and meeting specific work milestones, such as successful project completions, before shares become vested. Additional terms may apply regarding stock sales and transfers.\n\nThe article also mentions the importance of filing an 83(b) election to manage tax implications associated with receiving RSUs. However, it clarifies that these elections aren't applicable to RSUs themselves, which fall under a separate section of the tax code.\n\nIt seems there was a mistake in your input, mentioning RSU cancellation and redirecting users to another website. This content does not align with the original summary request. Summary: The provided text outlines the purpose and mechanics of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) as a tool for recruiting and motivating employees in startup environments. It explains two types of RSUs—single-trigger and double-trigger—and highlights factors influencing vesting schedules, including tenure and achievement of specific goals. Additionally, the article briefly addresses the role of 83(b) elections in managing the tax impact of RSU grants, emphasizing that these elections do not apply to RSUs. The article examines the strategic use of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) by companies, particularly startups, as a means to secure dedicated personnel during critical growth phases. These units act as equity-based compensation, offering a stake in the company's future success. Vesting schedules, either based solely on time served (single-trigger) or contingent upon achieving particular objectives (double-trigger), govern when these shares convert into owned assets. Furthermore, the piece delves into"
