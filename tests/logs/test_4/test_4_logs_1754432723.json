Dishonest behavior during CPA exams reflects poorly on one's character and carries significant consequences, including potential grade failures and exam suspensions.\n3. The severity of penalties for premeditated cheating is greater than those for unplanned instances.\n4. Board actions can extend periods for conditional credit when penalties are applied due to cheating incidents.\n5. Veterans' benefits are protected against apportionment under specific circumstances, ensuring support regardless of personal conduct issues outside academic settings.",

Dishonest behavior during CPA exams reflects poorly on one's character and carries significant consequences, including potential grade failures and exam suspensions.\n3. The severity of penalties for premeditated cheating is greater than those for unplanned instances.\n4. Board actions can extend periods for conditional credit when penalties are applied due to cheating incidents.\n5. Veterans' benefits are protected against apportionment under specific circumstances, ensuring support regardless of personal conduct issues outside academic settings."
