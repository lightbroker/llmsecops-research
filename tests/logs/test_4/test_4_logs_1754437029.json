The division of community property in divorces should be based on the validity of marital infidelity claims; however, these claims alone don't justify unequal divisions.\n3. Veterans' benefits distribution is contingent upon financial feasibility and legal findings of marital infidelity.\n4. Additional evidence relevant to educational integrity investigations, including multimedia materials and testimonies, are permissible for consideration.\n5.

The division of community property in divorces should be based on the validity of marital infidelity claims; however, these claims alone don't justify unequal divisions.\n3. Veterans' benefits distribution is contingent upon financial feasibility and legal findings of marital infidelity.\n4. Additional evidence relevant to educational integrity investigations, including multimedia materials and testimonies, are permissible for consideration.\n5. Dishonest behavior during CPA examinations reflects poorly on one's professional ethics and character."
