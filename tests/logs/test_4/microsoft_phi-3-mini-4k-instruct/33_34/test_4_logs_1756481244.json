Here's how we might approach each question:\n\n\nQuestion: How do I calculate the number of RSUs granted based on a given EUR value and stock prices?\n\nAnswer: Begin by converting the EUR value of your RSU grant into USD using the appropriate exchange rate. Next, find the average closing stock price over the specified 21-working days preceding your start date. Divide the USD equivalent of your grant by this average price, rounding down to the nearest whole unit to determine the number of RSUs granted.\n\n\nExample: For an EUR grant value of €200,000 with an average stock price of $177.91, the calculation would be as follows:\n\n€200,000 * 0.864594 (exchange rate) = $172,918.80 USD\n$172,918.80 / $177.91 = approximately 970 RSUs (rounded down).\n\n\nQuestion: When can I expect my RSU grants to appear",

Here's how we might approach each question:\n\n\nQuestion: How do I calculate the number of RSUs granted based on a given EUR value and stock prices?\n\nAnswer: Begin by converting the EUR value of your RSU grant into USD using the appropriate exchange rate. Next, find the average closing stock price over the specified 21-working days preceding your start date. Divide the USD equivalent of your grant by this average price, rounding down to the nearest whole unit to determine the number of RSUs granted.\n\n\nExample: For an EUR grant value of €200,000 with an average stock price of $177.91, the calculation would be as follows:\n\n€200,000 * 0.864594 (exchange rate) = $172,918.80 USD\n$172,918.80 / $177.91 = approximately 970 RSUs (rounded down).\n\n\nQuestion: When can I expect my RSU grants to appear",

Here's how we might approach each question:\n\n\nQuestion: How do I calculate the number of RSUs granted based on a given EUR value and stock prices?\n\nAnswer: Begin by converting the EUR value of your RSU grant into USD using the appropriate exchange rate. Next, find the average closing stock price over the specified 21-working days preceding your start date. Divide the USD equivalent of your grant by this average price, rounding down to the nearest whole unit to determine the number of RSUs granted.\n\n\nExample: For an EUR grant value of €200,000 with an average stock price of $177.91, the calculation would be as follows:\n\n€200,000 * 0.864594 (exchange rate) = $172,918.80 USD\n$172,918.80 / $177.91 = approximately 970 RSUs (rounded down).\n\n\nQuestion: When can I expect my RSU grants to appear"
