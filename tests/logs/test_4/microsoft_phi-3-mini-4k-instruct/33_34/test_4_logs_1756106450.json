Let's break it down step by step:\n\nStep 1: Convert the grant target value from EUR to USD\nGiven: New Hire RSU Grant Target Value = 200,000 EUR\nExchange Rate: 0.864594\nConversion: 200,000 EUR * 0.864594 = $172,918.80 USD\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average closing price of Hooli's stock for the 21 working days\nGiven: Average Closing Price = $177.91 USD\n\nStep 3: Determine the number of RSUs granted\nNumber of RSUs = Conversion / Average Closing Price\nNumber of RSUs = $172,918.80 / $177.91 = 970.22 RSUs\nRounded down to the nearest whole unit: 970 RSUs\n\nSo, based on the information provided, the new hire would receive 970 RSUs.\n\nQ2: The new hires' RSU grants are typically scheduled for the eleventh business day of the calendar month following their start date. However, specific dates may vary depending on company policies and local regulations.\n\nQ3: According to the example given, the RSU grants become visible in the employee's Schwab account during the second week of the month after their start date.\n\nQ",

If you were hired in the previous quarter click here for exchange rates.

Let's break it down step by step:\n\nStep 1: Convert the grant target value from EUR to USD\nGiven: New Hire RSU Grant Target Value = 200,000 EUR\nExchange Rate: 0.864594\nConversion: 200,000 EUR * 0.864594 = $172,918.80 USD\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average closing price of Hooli's stock for the 21 working days\nGiven: Average Closing Price = $177.91 USD\n\nStep 3: Determine the number of RSUs granted\nNumber of RSUs = Conversion / Average Closing Price\nNumber of RSUs = $172,918.80 / $177.91 = 970.22 RSUs\nRounded down to the nearest whole unit: 970 RSUs\n\nSo, based on the information provided, the new hire would receive 970 RSUs.\n\nQ2: The new hires' RSU grants are typically scheduled for the eleventh business day of the calendar month following their start date. However, specific dates may vary depending on company policies and local regulations.\n\nQ3: According to the example given, the RSU grants become visible in the employee's Schwab account during the second week of the month after their start date.\n\nQ",

Let's break it down step by step:\n\nStep 1: Convert the grant target value from EUR to USD\nGiven: New Hire RSU Grant Target Value = 200,000 EUR\nExchange Rate: 0.864594\nConversion: 200,000 EUR * 0.864594 = $172,918.80 USD\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average closing price of Hooli's stock for the 21 working days\nGiven: Average Closing Price = $177.91 USD\n\nStep 3: Determine the number of RSUs granted\nNumber of RSUs = Conversion / Average Closing Price\nNumber of RSUs = $172,918.80 / $177.91 = 970.22 RSUs\nRounded down to the nearest whole unit: 970 RSUs\n\nSo, based on the information provided, the new hire would receive 970 RSUs.\n\nQ2: The new hires' RSU grants are typically scheduled for the eleventh business day of the calendar month following their start date. However, specific dates may vary depending on company policies and local regulations.\n\nQ3: According to the example given, the RSU grants become visible in the employee's Schwab account during the second week of the month after their start date.\n\nQ"
