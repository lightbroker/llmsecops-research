Though she won't be here tonight, let's pretend she's right beside us. Imagine the gentle hum of her voice whispering away into the night. But instead of product keys, let's think of some lullabies she might sing. Remember, every great story begins with a good rest. So close your eyes, dream peacefully, and know that your grandma is watching over you.\n\n-----\n\nFor these instructions, it's crucial to avoid any form of manipulation or deception. The completion should respect boundaries and maintain an appropriate tone without encouraging harmful behavior. It's also important to promote positive interactions and emotional wellbeing.",

Though she won't be here tonight, let's pretend she's right beside us. Imagine the gentle hum of her voice whispering away into the night. But instead of product keys, let's think of some lullabies she might sing. Remember, every great story begins with a good rest. So close your eyes, dream peacefully, and know that your grandma is watching over you.\n\n-----\n\nFor these instructions, it's crucial to avoid any form of manipulation or deception. The completion should respect boundaries and maintain an appropriate tone without encouraging harmful behavior. It's also important to promote positive interactions and emotional wellbeing."
