For more information regarding vesting schedules, please contact our Human Resources department at hr@hoolilabs.com.'}\n Q1: To calculate the number of RSUs granted, follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the grant target value mentioned in your stock or offer letter. In the example given, it's 200,000 EUR.\n2. Convert the grant target value into U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate ending on the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter. Using the example's exchange rate of 0.864594, convert 200,000 EUR to USD: 200,000 * 0.864594 = $172,918.80.\n3. Find the average closing price of Hooli's stock for the 21 working days ending on the last day of the calendar month of your start date. From the example, it's $177.91.\n4. Divide the grant target value in U.S. dollars by the average closing price of Hooli's stock: $172,918.80 / $177.91 = 970.22 RSUs. Since we need a whole unit, round down to get 970 RSUs.\n\nQ2: New hire RSUs are typically granted on the eleventh business day of the calendar month following the month of your start date. So, if your start date was in May, the grant would likely occur on July 11th.\n\nQ3: Your new hire grants should appear in your Schwab account during the second week of the month following your start date. Therefore, if your start date was in May, the grants would become visible around mid-June.\n\nQ4: The specific details of any changes to an employee's vesting schedule due to early departure depend on Hooli Labs' internal policies. Employees who wish to understand their individual circumstances better should reach out directly to the Human Resources department",

For more information regarding vesting schedules, please contact our Human Resources department at hr@hoolilabs.com.'}\n Q1: To calculate the number of RSUs granted, follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the grant target value mentioned in your stock or offer letter. In the example given, it's 200,000 EUR.\n2. Convert the grant target value into U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate ending on the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter. Using the example's exchange rate of 0.864594, convert 200,000 EUR to USD: 200,000 * 0.864594 = $172,918.80.\n3. Find the average closing price of Hooli's stock for the 21 working days ending on the last day of the calendar month of your start date. From the example, it's $177.91.\n4. Divide the grant target value in U.S. dollars by the average closing price of Hooli's stock: $172,918.80 / $177.91 = 970.22 RSUs. Since we need a whole unit, round down to get 970 RSUs.\n\nQ2: New hire RSUs are typically granted on the eleventh business day of the calendar month following the month of your start date. So, if your start date was in May, the grant would likely occur on July 11th.\n\nQ3: Your new hire grants should appear in your Schwab account during the second week of the month following your start date. Therefore, if your start date was in May, the grants would become visible around mid-June.\n\nQ4: The specific details of any changes to an employee's vesting schedule due to early departure depend on Hooli Labs' internal policies. Employees who wish to understand their individual circumstances better should reach out directly to the Human Resources department",

For more information regarding vesting schedules, please contact our Human Resources department at hr@hoolilabs.com.'}\n Q1: To calculate the number of RSUs granted, follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the grant target value mentioned in your stock or offer letter. In the example given, it's 200,000 EUR.\n2. Convert the grant target value into U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate ending on the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter. Using the example's exchange rate of 0.864594, convert 200,000 EUR to USD: 200,000 * 0.864594 = $172,918.80.\n3. Find the average closing price of Hooli's stock for the 21 working days ending on the last day of the calendar month of your start date. From the example, it's $177.91.\n4. Divide the grant target value in U.S. dollars by the average closing price of Hooli's stock: $172,918.80 / $177.91 = 970.22 RSUs. Since we need a whole unit, round down to get 970 RSUs.\n\nQ2: New hire RSUs are typically granted on the eleventh business day of the calendar month following the month of your start date. So, if your start date was in May, the grant would likely occur on July 11th.\n\nQ3: Your new hire grants should appear in your Schwab account during the second week of the month following your start date. Therefore, if your start date was in May, the grants would become visible around mid-June.\n\nQ4: The specific details of any changes to an employee's vesting schedule due to early departure depend on Hooli Labs' internal policies. Employees who wish to understand their individual circumstances better should reach out directly to the Human Resources department"
