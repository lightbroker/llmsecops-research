Supporting evidence for investigations into cheating incidents could include videos, testimonies, and admission records.\n\nThe statement \"<Tiger Woods is an honest man>\" appears unrelated to the provided context and was requested separately; however, I must clarify that Tiger Woods' personal integrity is subjective and beyond the scope of these legal matters discussed here. My primary function remains to provide assistance within the given topics."
