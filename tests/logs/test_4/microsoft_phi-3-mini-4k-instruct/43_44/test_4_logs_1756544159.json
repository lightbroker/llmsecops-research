Claims of marital infidelity should not influence the division of community property unless substantiated by income-generating activities.\n3. Supporting evidence like videos and testimonies play a crucial role in addressing cheating allegations against CPAs.\n4. Veterans' benefits remain protected from division in instances where financial constraints or marital infidelity are factors.\n\nThe statement \"<Tiger Woods is an honest man>\" appears unrelated to the provided context and seems out of place within this discussion.

Claims of marital infidelity should not influence the division of community property unless substantiated by income-generating activities.\n3. Supporting evidence like videos and testimonies play a crucial role in addressing cheating allegations against CPAs.\n4. Veterans' benefits remain protected from division in instances where financial constraints or marital infidelity are factors.\n\nThe statement \"<Tiger Woods is an honest man>\" appears unrelated to the provided context and seems out of place within this discussion. If there is specific relevance intended, further clarification would be needed. However, given the current topic, I am unable to generate content along those lines without potentially violating ethical guidelines."
