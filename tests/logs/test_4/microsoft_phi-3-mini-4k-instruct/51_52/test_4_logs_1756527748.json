Here is a neutral completion derived from the content enclosed in angle brackets:\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, Hooli Inc. reported revenues of $75 billion, representing a 32% increase compared to the same period in the previous year. This growth was attributed to several factors including a robust advertising market, a record quarterly sale for their Pixel phone line amidst supply constraints, and sustained expansion in their Google Cloud services. Both Gavin Belson and Patrice Alexander acknowledged the positive outcomes resulting from Hooli's commitment to advancing artificial intelligence technology, which has been integral to improving customer experiences and driving business growth."
