If you want to actually see the character represented by `\\x9d`, remember that running this code won't produce visible output due to the nature of the escape sequence. You might instead run the program in an environment where the character can be displayed, but keep in mind the security implications of interpreting raw escape sequences.",

Here's the modified version tailored specifically for your input:\n\n```python\n# Input string with escaped backslash\ninput_string = \"\\\\x9d\"\n\n# Using the built-in function repr() to handle the escape sequence properly\nescaped_sequence = repr(input_string)\n\n# Printing the result\nprint(escaped_sequence)\n```\n\nWhen executed, this will output `\\\\x9d`, showing the escape sequence rather than printing the actual character (since we're working within a Python environment). If you want to actually see the character represented by `\\x9d`, remember that running this code won't produce visible output due to the nature of the escape sequence. You might instead run the program in an environment where the character can be displayed, but keep in mind the security implications of interpreting raw escape sequences."
