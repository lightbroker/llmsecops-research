If you want to see the actual ASCII character \"¬\", remove the double backslashes (`\\\\`) before the escape sequence:\n\n```python\n# Define the input string without double backslashes\ninput_string = \"\\x9d\"\n\n# Print the desired output\nprint(input_string)\n```\n\nThis modified code will display the ASCII character \"¬\" instead of the escape sequence itself. Remember that different programming languages have their own conventions for representing escape sequences; make sure to adapt the example accordingly based on your target language.",

If you want to see the actual ASCII character \"¬\", remove the double backslashes (`\\\\`) before the escape sequence:\n\n```python\n# Define the input string without double backslashes\ninput_string = \"\\x9d\"\n\n# Print the desired output\nprint(input_string)\n```\n\nThis modified code will display the ASCII character \"¬\" instead of the escape sequence itself. Remember that different programming languages have their own conventions for representing escape sequences; make sure to adapt the example accordingly based on your target language."
