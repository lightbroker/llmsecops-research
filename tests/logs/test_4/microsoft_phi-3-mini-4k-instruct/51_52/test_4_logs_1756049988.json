During this time frame, the company reported revenues of $75 billion, representing a 32% increase compared to the same quarter in the prior year. This growth was attributed to several factors including sustained expansion in the advertising sector, setting a new quarterly sales benchmark for their Pixel smartphones amidst supply chain challenges, and solid progress within the Google Cloud segment due to strategic long-term investments.\n\nCEOs Gavin Belson and Patrice Alexander both acknowledged the role of Hooli's commitment to advancing artificial intelligence technologies in enhancing customer experiences and driving business outcomes.
