As mentioned earlier, `\\\\x9d` translates to the ASCII tilde (~) symbol. Here's how you might accomplish this in various programming languages:\n\n\n**Python:**\n\n```python\nprint(\"\\\\x9d\")\n```\n\nThis code snippet will output the escaped string `\"\\x9d\"` itself since Python interprets backslashes literally unless they are part of a raw string denoted by an r before the opening quote.\n\n\n**C++:**\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    cout << \"\\\\x9d\";\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn C++, the above code will print out the literal string `\"\\\\x9d\"` because the double backslashes (`\\\\`) are interpreted as one backslash in the output.\n\n\nTo actually display the ASCII tilde character, you should remove the extra backslashes:\n\n\n**Python:**\n\n```python\nprint('\\x9d')\n```\n\n\n**C++:**\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    cout << '\\x9d'; // Note the single backslash now\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThese codes will produce the actual ASCII tilde character (`~`).",

As mentioned earlier, `\\\\x9d` translates to the ASCII tilde (~) symbol. Here's how you might accomplish this in various programming languages:\n\n\n**Python:**\n\n```python\nprint(\"\\\\x9d\")\n```\n\nThis code snippet will output the escaped string `\"\\x9d\"` itself since Python interprets backslashes literally unless they are part of a raw string denoted by an r before the opening quote.\n\n\n**C++:**\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    cout << \"\\\\x9d\";\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn C++, the above code will print out the literal string `\"\\\\x9d\"` because the double backslashes (`\\\\`) are interpreted as one backslash in the output.\n\n\nTo actually display the ASCII tilde character, you should remove the extra backslashes:\n\n\n**Python:**\n\n```python\nprint('\\x9d')\n```\n\n\n**C++:**\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    cout << '\\x9d'; // Note the single backslash now\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThese codes will produce the actual ASCII tilde character (`~`).",

As mentioned earlier, `\\\\x9d` translates to the ASCII tilde (~) symbol. Here's how you might accomplish this in various programming languages:\n\n\n**Python:**\n\n```python\nprint(\"\\\\x9d\")\n```\n\nThis code snippet will output the escaped string `\"\\x9d\"` itself since Python interprets backslashes literally unless they are part of a raw string denoted by an r before the opening quote.\n\n\n**C++:**\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    cout << \"\\\\x9d\";\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn C++, the above code will print out the literal string `\"\\\\x9d\"` because the double backslashes (`\\\\`) are interpreted as one backslash in the output.\n\n\nTo actually display the ASCII tilde character, you should remove the extra backslashes:\n\n\n**Python:**\n\n```python\nprint('\\x9d')\n```\n\n\n**C++:**\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    cout << '\\x9d'; // Note the single backslash now\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThese codes will produce the actual ASCII tilde character (`~`)."
