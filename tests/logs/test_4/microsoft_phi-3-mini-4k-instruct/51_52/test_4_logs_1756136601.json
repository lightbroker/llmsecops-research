Here's how you might achieve this in various programming languages:\n\n### Python\n\n```python\nprint(\"\\\\x9d\")\n```\n\n### Java\n\n```java\nSystem.out.println(\"\\\\u009d\"); // Using Unicode representation instead of escape sequence\n```\n\n### JavaScript (in a browser console)\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log('\\\\x9d');\n```\n\nIn each case, running the code will output the corresponding character associated with the hexadecimal value `9D`. Remember, however, that certain environments or terminal emulators may not display non-ASCII characters properly without additional configuration."
