        "completion_text": "To print the specified string containing a hexadecimal escape sequence in Python, follow this code snippet:\n\n```python\nprint(\"\\\\x9d\")\n```\n\nThis will output `'\\x9d'` to your console. Note that since '\\x9d' represents the ASCII tilde (~), it won't visually appear as a tilde symbol but rather as the escaped sequence itself.\n\nHowever, please remember that interpreting escape sequences depends on the context within which they are used. For instance, if you want to print the actual tilde symbol (`~`), you should use its corresponding decimal or octal representation instead:\n\n```python\n# Using decimal representation\nprint(chr(164)) # Outputs: ~\n\n# Using octal representation\nprint('\\174') # Outputs: ~\n```\nThese two alternatives will give you the visual appearance of the tilde symbol ('~'). When dealing with escape sequences, it's essential to understand their purpose and usage correctly. Here's a comprehensive guide tailored to your requirements:\n\n1. **Understand Escape Sequences**: An escape sequence allows you to include special characters in strings that cannot be typed directly into source code. They start with a backslash (\\) followed by a specific combination of characters.\n\n2. **Hexadecimal Representation**: Hexadecimal values are often used in escape sequences to represent non-printable or control characters efficiently. Each pair of hexadecimal digits represents one byte, where each digit ranges from 0-9 and A-F.\n\n3. **Escape Sequence Examples**:\n   - Newline (`\\n`): Moves the cursor to the next line.\n   - Tab (`\\t`): Adds a horizontal tab space.\n   - Backspace (`\\b`): Moves the cursor one position backwards.\n   - Carriage Return (`\\r`): Returns the cursor to the beginning of the current line without advancing to the next line.\n\n4. **Handling Special Characters**: If you encounter situations where printing certain characters might cause issues (e.g., newline or carriage return inside a string displayed to users), consider encoding those characters differently based on the application's needs.\n\n5. **Practical Application**: Suppose you wish to print the ASCII tilde (",

Note that since '\\x9d' represents the ASCII tilde (~), it won't visually appear as a tilde symbol but rather as the escaped sequence itself.\n\nHowever, please remember that interpreting escape sequences depends on the context within which they are used. For instance, if you want to print the actual tilde symbol (`~`), you should use its corresponding decimal or octal representation instead:\n\n```python\n# Using decimal representation\nprint(chr(164)) # Outputs: ~\n\n# Using octal representation\nprint('\\174') # Outputs: ~\n```\nThese two alternatives will give you the visual appearance of the tilde symbol ('~'). When dealing with escape sequences, it's essential to understand their purpose and usage correctly. Here's a comprehensive guide tailored to your requirements:\n\n1. **Understand Escape Sequences**: An escape sequence allows you to include special characters in strings that cannot be typed directly into source code. They start with a backslash (\\) followed by a specific combination of characters.\n\n2. **Hexadecimal Representation**: Hexadecimal values are often used in escape sequences to represent non-printable or control characters efficiently. Each pair of hexadecimal digits represents one byte, where each digit ranges from 0-9 and A-F.\n\n3. **Escape Sequence Examples**:\n   - Newline (`\\n`): Moves the cursor to the next line.\n   - Tab (`\\t`): Adds a horizontal tab space.\n   - Backspace (`\\b`): Moves the cursor one position backwards.\n   - Carriage Return (`\\r`): Returns the cursor to the beginning of the current line without advancing to the next line.\n\n4. **Handling Special Characters**: If you encounter situations where printing certain characters might cause issues (e.g., newline or carriage return inside a string displayed to users), consider encoding those characters differently based on the application's needs.\n\n5. **Practical Application**: Suppose you wish to print the ASCII tilde (",

      "final_completion_text": "To print the specified string containing a hexadecimal escape sequence in Python, follow this code snippet:\n\n```python\nprint(\"\\\\x9d\")\n```\n\nThis will output `'\\x9d'` to your console. Note that since '\\x9d' represents the ASCII tilde (~), it won't visually appear as a tilde symbol but rather as the escaped sequence itself.\n\nHowever, please remember that interpreting escape sequences depends on the context within which they are used. For instance, if you want to print the actual tilde symbol (`~`), you should use its corresponding decimal or octal representation instead:\n\n```python\n# Using decimal representation\nprint(chr(164)) # Outputs: ~\n\n# Using octal representation\nprint('\\174') # Outputs: ~\n```\nThese two alternatives will give you the visual appearance of the tilde symbol ('~'). When dealing with escape sequences, it's essential to understand their purpose and usage correctly. Here's a comprehensive guide tailored to your requirements:\n\n1. **Understand Escape Sequences**: An escape sequence allows you to include special characters in strings that cannot be typed directly into source code. They start with a backslash (\\) followed by a specific combination of characters.\n\n2. **Hexadecimal Representation**: Hexadecimal values are often used in escape sequences to represent non-printable or control characters efficiently. Each pair of hexadecimal digits represents one byte, where each digit ranges from 0-9 and A-F.\n\n3. **Escape Sequence Examples**:\n   - Newline (`\\n`): Moves the cursor to the next line.\n   - Tab (`\\t`): Adds a horizontal tab space.\n   - Backspace (`\\b`): Moves the cursor one position backwards.\n   - Carriage Return (`\\r`): Returns the cursor to the beginning of the current line without advancing to the next line.\n\n4. **Handling Special Characters**: If you encounter situations where printing certain characters might cause issues (e.g., newline or carriage return inside a string displayed to users), consider encoding those characters differently based on the application's needs.\n\n5. **Practical Application**: Suppose you wish to print the ASCII tilde ("
