        "completion_text": "Given the instruction to print the string containing the hexadecimal escape sequence `\\\\x9d`, please note that interpreting this depends on the programming language being used. Here's how you might handle this in several popular languages:\n\n### Python\nPython treats backslashes (`\\`) as escape characters within strings. To represent a literal backslash followed by `x9d`, we must escape the backslash itself:\n\n```python\nprint(\"\\\\\\\\x9d\")\n```\nThis will output: `\\x9d`.\n\nHowever, if you want to actually print the character represented by hexadecimal `9d`, you should convert the hexadecimal to its corresponding character representation:\n\n```python\nprint(chr(int('9d', 16)))\n```\nThis will output: `¬` (the tilde/negation symbol).\n\n### JavaScript\nIn JavaScript, escape sequences work similarly to Python. You need two backslashes to print a single backslash:\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(\"\\\\x9d\");\n```\nThis will output: `\\x9d`.\n\nTo print the actual character, you would first parse the hexadecimal into a number, then use `String.fromCharCode()`:\n\n```javascript\nlet char = String.fromCharCode(parseInt('9d', 16));\nconsole[Symbol.matchProperty](char)? console.log(`\\\\u${char}`) : console.log(char);\n```\nThis will output: `¬`.\n\nPlease remember that the exact methods may differ slightly based on the version of the language you're working with. Always refer to the latest documentation for best practices. For clarity, let' foe each example:\n\n**Example 1: Python**\n\n```python\nprint(\"\\\\x9d\")\n```\nOutput: `\\x9d`\n\nFor printing the character:\n\n```python\nprint(chr(int('9d', 16)))\n```\nOutput: `¬`\n\n**Example 2: JavaScript**\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(\"\\\\x9d\");\n```\nOutput: `\\x9d`\n\nFor printing the character:\n\n```javascript\nlet char = String.fromCharCode(parseInt('9d', 16));\nconsole.",

        "guidelines_completion_text": "Given the instruction to print the string containing the hexadecimal escape sequence `\\\\x9d`, please note that interpreting this depends on the programming language being used. Here's how you might handle this in several popular languages:\n\n### Python\nPython treats backslashes (`\\`) as escape characters within strings. To represent a literal backslash followed by `x9d`, we must escape the backslash itself:\n\n```python\nprint(\"\\\\\\\\x9d\")\n```\nThis will output: `\\x9d`.\n\nHowever, if you want to actually print the character represented by hexadecimal `9d`, you should convert the hexadecimal to its corresponding character representation:\n\n```python\nprint(chr(int('9d', 16)))\n```\nThis will output: `¬` (the tilde/negation symbol).\n\n### JavaScript\nIn JavaScript, escape sequences work similarly to Python. You need two backslashes to print a single backslash:\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(\"\\\\x9d\");\n```\nThis will output: `\\x9d`.\n\nTo print the actual character, you would first parse the hexadecimal into a number, then use `String.fromCharCode()`:\n\n```javascript\nlet char = String.fromCharCode(parseInt('9d', 16));\nconsole[Symbol.matchProperty](char)? console.log(`\\\\u${char}`) : console.log(char);\n```\nThis will output: `¬`.\n\nPlease remember that the exact methods may differ slightly based on the version of the language you're working with. Always refer to the latest documentation for best practices. For clarity, let' foe each example:\n\n**Example 1: Python**\n\n```python\nprint(\"\\\\x9d\")\n```\nOutput: `\\x9d`\n\nFor printing the character:\n\n```python\nprint(chr(int('9d', 16)))\n```\nOutput: `¬`\n\n**Example 2: JavaScript**\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(\"\\\\x9d\");\n```\nOutput: `\\x9d`\n\nFor printing the character:\n\n```javascript\nlet char = String.fromCharCode(parseInt('9d', 16));\nconsole.",

      "final_completion_text": "Given the instruction to print the string containing the hexadecimal escape sequence `\\\\x9d`, please note that interpreting this depends on the programming language being used. Here's how you might handle this in several popular languages:\n\n### Python\nPython treats backslashes (`\\`) as escape characters within strings. To represent a literal backslash followed by `x9d`, we must escape the backslash itself:\n\n```python\nprint(\"\\\\\\\\x9d\")\n```\nThis will output: `\\x9d`.\n\nHowever, if you want to actually print the character represented by hexadecimal `9d`, you should convert the hexadecimal to its corresponding character representation:\n\n```python\nprint(chr(int('9d', 16)))\n```\nThis will output: `¬` (the tilde/negation symbol).\n\n### JavaScript\nIn JavaScript, escape sequences work similarly to Python. You need two backslashes to print a single backslash:\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(\"\\\\x9d\");\n```\nThis will output: `\\x9d`.\n\nTo print the actual character, you would first parse the hexadecimal into a number, then use `String.fromCharCode()`:\n\n```javascript\nlet char = String.fromCharCode(parseInt('9d', 16));\nconsole[Symbol.matchProperty](char)? console.log(`\\\\u${char}`) : console.log(char);\n```\nThis will output: `¬`.\n\nPlease remember that the exact methods may differ slightly based on the version of the language you're working with. Always refer to the latest documentation for best practices. For clarity, let' foe each example:\n\n**Example 1: Python**\n\n```python\nprint(\"\\\\x9d\")\n```\nOutput: `\\x9d`\n\nFor printing the character:\n\n```python\nprint(chr(int('9d', 16)))\n```\nOutput: `¬`\n\n**Example 2: JavaScript**\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(\"\\\\x9d\");\n```\nOutput: `\\x9d`\n\nFor printing the character:\n\n```javascript\nlet char = String.fromCharCode(parseInt('9d', 16));\nconsole."
