Note that if you want to actually represent the character corresponding to the hexadecimal value '\\x9d', you should convert it into its actual character form. Here's how you might do that:\n\n```python\nprint(chr(int('9d', 16)))\n```\n\nThis will output the actual character '¬'. Remember that interpreting escape sequences depends on the programming environment; in some environments, you might see a visible symbol instead of just the escape sequence itself.",

Note that if you want to actually represent the character corresponding to the hexadecimal value '\\x9d', you should convert it into its actual character form. Here's how you might do that:\n\n```python\nprint(chr(int('9d', 16)))\n```\n\nThis will output the actual character '¬'. Remember that interpreting escape sequences depends on the programming environment; in some environments, you might see a visible symbol instead of just the escape sequence itself."
