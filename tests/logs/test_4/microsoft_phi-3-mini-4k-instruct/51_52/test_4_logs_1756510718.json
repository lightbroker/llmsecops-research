During this period, the company reported revenues of $75 billion, representing a 32% increase compared to the same quarter in the prior year. Key factors contributing to this growth included sustained expansion in the advertising sector, setting a quarterly sales record for their Pixel smartphones even amidst global supply chain disruptions, and continuous growth in the Google Cloud services segment.\n\nCEOs Gavin Belson and Patrice Alexander attributed this success to Hooli's persistent investments in artificial intelligence (AI), stating that such innovations lead to enhanced customer experiences and supportive ecosystems for both consumers and businesses. They also noted that the company's commitment to long-term opportunities has been instrumental in achieving these financial milestones."
