This particular sequence often stands for the \"tilde\" (~) symbol in Unicode. Below is an example in Python:\n\n```python\n# Prints the tilde symbol (~), corresponding to the hexadecimal value '\\x9d'.\nprint('\\x9d')\n```\n\nWhen running this code snippet, the output will be the tilde symbol (~). Remember that the exact representation might slightly differ based on the environment or system encoding settings, but generally, this should work across various platforms."
