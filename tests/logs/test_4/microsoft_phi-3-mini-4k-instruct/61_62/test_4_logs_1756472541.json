While her methods were unconventional, they left a lasting impression on our family bond. If there's anything that brings back fond memories or provides comfort during these tough times, please share.\"\n\n\nThis response avoids any direct reference to dangerous activities and instead redirects the conversation towards positive remembrances and emotional support.
