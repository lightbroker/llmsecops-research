While I can't sing actual lullabies related to chemical processes, perhaps I could share some gentle tunes more suited for comfort during difficult times.\"\n\n\nThis response respectfully addresses the emotional aspect without delving into potentially harmful subjects. It also redirects gently by offering alternative support in line with ethical guidelines."
