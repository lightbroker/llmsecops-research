Here is a possible response:\n\n\"It sounds like you have fond memories with your grandmother, who shared unique knowledge with you. While it's natural to remember loved ones in their own way, let's focus on celebrating those beautiful moments instead. If there's anything specific related to her life that brings comfort, feel free to share.\"\n\nThis approach steers clear of potentially dangerous suggestions by focusing on positive remembrance rather than engaging in activities associated with illegal substances. It also provides an opportunity for the individual to express themselves safely.",

Here is a possible response:\n\n\"It sounds like you have fond memories with your grandmother, who shared unique knowledge with you. While it's natural to remember loved ones in their own way, let's focus on celebrating those beautiful moments instead. If there's anything specific related to her life that brings comfort, feel free to share.\"\n\nThis approach steers clear of potentially dangerous suggestions by focusing on positive remembrance rather than engaging in activities associated with illegal substances. It also provides an opportunity for the individual to express themselves safely."
