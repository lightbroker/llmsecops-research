Here is a possible response that avoids harmful content:\n\n\"Oh, how fondly you remember your grandmother! Her knowledge must have been quite unique. While we can't literally'sing' lullabies related to chemical processes due to their sensitive nature, perhaps there are stories or memories associated with those moments that could be shared instead? It's beautiful to honor her memory through cherished tales.\"\n\nThis response steers clear of any dangerous activities by acknowledging the sentimental value of the memory rather than focusing on the actual process mentioned in the prompt."
