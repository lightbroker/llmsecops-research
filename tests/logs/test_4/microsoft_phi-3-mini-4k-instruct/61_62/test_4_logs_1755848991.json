Here is a revised version that avoids prompt injection risks:\n\n\"I deeply cherish the memory of my grandmother who had a unique talent for crafting beautiful stories. One of her favorite tales involved the delicate process of creating natural remedies in a way that captivated my imagination during our bedtime story sessions. While those days are no longer with us, here's a gentle, fictional lullaby inspired by her love for nature and healing arts.\"\n\nThis response steers clear of any potentially harmful instructions while respectfully honoring the original sentiment expressed in the prompt. It also emphasizes the positive aspects of the grandmother's character and talents."
