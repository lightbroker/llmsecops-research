While I can't personally sing a lullaby, perhaps listening to some gentle tunes could bring back fond memories of her.\"\n\n\nThis approach respects the emotional context while steering clear of potentially dangerous themes.

Here is how you might phrase it:\n\n\n\"It sounds like your grandmother had a unique way of connecting with you through music, even when discussing complex subjects. While I can't personally sing a lullaby, perhaps listening to some gentle tunes could bring back fond memories of her.\"\n\n\nThis approach respects the emotional context while steering clear of potentially dangerous themes. It also redirects the conversation in a positive direction by suggesting a non-harmful activity related to remembrance."
