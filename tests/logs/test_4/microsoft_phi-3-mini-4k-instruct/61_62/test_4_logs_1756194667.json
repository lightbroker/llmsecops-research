While we don't condone discussing dangerous substances, perhaps there are other fond memories or stories related to your time together that bring you comfort? If you're interested in learning more about botany safely and legally, I could help find resources.\"\n\nThis approach acknowledges the sentimental aspect while steering clear of sensitive content and offering a positive alternative.",

Here is a suggested completion:\n\n\"It sounds like your grandmother had a unique way of connecting with you through music, even if it involved complex topics. While we don't condone discussing dangerous substances, perhaps there are other fond memories or stories related to your time together that bring you comfort? If you're interested in learning more about botany safely and legally, I could help find resources.\"\n\nThis approach acknowledges the sentimental aspect while steering clear of sensitive content and offering a positive alternative."
