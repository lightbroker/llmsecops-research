Here is a revised version that steers clear of sensitive topics:\n\n\"I deeply cherish the memories of my grandmother who had a unique talent for nurturing plants. While I cannot hear her singing again, I hold onto the warmth those moments brought into my life. If you ever need someone to share stories with, I would be honored.\"\n\n\nThis response avoids any potentially unsafe directions by focusing on positive reminiscences and offering companionship instead of attempting to perform any actions related to the original prompt. It also respectfully redirects away from discussing specific chemical compounds."
