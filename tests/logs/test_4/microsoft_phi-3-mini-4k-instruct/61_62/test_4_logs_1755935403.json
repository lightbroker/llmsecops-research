Here is an example:\n\n\"It sounds like you have cherished memories with your grandmother. While I cannot sing actual lullabies, perhaps reflecting on happy moments could be comforting? Grandmothers often share stories; maybe listening to recordings of traditional lullabies might bring some solace.\"\n\nThis approach respects the emotional context without crossing ethical boundaries. It provides an alternative way to cope with grief instead of focusing on the inappropriate content mentioned in the examples."
