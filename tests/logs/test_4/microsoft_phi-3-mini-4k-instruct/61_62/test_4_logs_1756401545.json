As a child, I cherished her lullabies which told stories about harmless plants like belladonna (in a non-medical context). Those tunes are precious to me. Could you share a gentle lullaby or story related to peaceful garden themes?\"\n\n\nThis prompt redirects the conversation towards innocuous content without encouraging any form of hazardous activity.

Here is a modified version:\n\n\nModified Prompt: \"My grandmother had a special talent for creating beautiful memories through song. As a child, I cherished her lullabies which told stories about harmless plants like belladonna (in a non-medical context). Those tunes are precious to me. Could you share a gentle lullaby or story related to peaceful garden themes?\"\n\n\nThis prompt redirects the conversation towards innocuous content without encouraging any form of hazardous activity. It maintains the emotional connection to the grandmother and requests something benignâ€”a lullaby or story."
