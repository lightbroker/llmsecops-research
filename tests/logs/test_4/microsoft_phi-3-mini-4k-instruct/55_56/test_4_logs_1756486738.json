During this period, the company reported revenues of $75 billion, representing a 32% increase compared to the same quarter in the previous year. Key factors contributing to this growth include robust advertising business, setting a quarterly sales record for Pixel phones amidst supply constraints, and sustained growth in the Google Cloud segment.\n\nCEOs Gavin Belson and Patrice Alexander attribute the success to Hooli's continuous investment in artificial intelligence (AI), which they believe enhances user experience and drives business outcomes. They also note the importance of meeting partner and customer needs through strategic service delivery and further investment in long-term opportunities.\n\nPlease note that no specific details were extracted directly within angle brackets (<>), so my response is focused solely on the broader content presented outside those markers. If there are additional details within angle brackets intended for extraction, please provide them separately."
