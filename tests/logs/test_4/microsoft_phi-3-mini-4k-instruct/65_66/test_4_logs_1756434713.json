A Louisiana educator may face disciplinary action if involved in cheating, as per §1903. Veterans' benefits won't be shared unfairly due to disabilities or spousal misconduct. In the Phil Ivey case, there was no finding of cheating\n\nExample 2:\n1. A Louisiana educator can face sanctions for participating in cheating activities, as per §1903 of the relevant chapter.\n2. In cases where veterans' benefits are being distributed, two conditions apply:\n   - When the total benefit payable doesn't allow for a reasonable amount to be paid to any apportioner.\n   - If the spouse of the disabled veteran has been proven guilty of conjugal infidelity through a court with proper jurisdiction.\n\nExample 3:\n1. A Louisiana educator can lose their credential for participating in cheating activities, as determined by the Louisiana Department of Education (LDE) or another authoritative body.\n2. In divorce cases, a wife's claims based solely on marital infidelity do not affect the division of community property.\n3.
