        "completion_text": "\\nQ4: What happens when I sell my shares before vesting?\\\n A: Selling shares prior to vesting may result in a taxable event depending on the specific circumstances surrounding the sale. It is recommended that you consult with a tax advisor for personalized advice. Generally, any gains realized from selling vested shares would typically be subject to capital gains taxes. However, there could also be potential clawback provisions based on company policies regarding early sales of restricted stock units. Please review your company's policy and consult with a financial advisor for guidance tailored to your situation.\n\nFor further clarification, consider these questions:\n\nQ5: Are there any restrictions on how many RSUs can be sold at once?\nA: Yes, companies often have policies limiting the number of RSUs that can be sold within a certain time frame to prevent rapid dilution of existing shareholders' equity. These limits vary between organizations but should be outlined in your company's employee handbook or compensation plan documentation.\n\nQ6: Can an employee choose whether they want their RSUs to vest immediately or over several years?\nA: Typically, RSU vesting schedules are predetermined by the company's compensation plan. Some plans might allow employees to select different vesting schedules upon acceptance of the job offer; however, other plans require immediate vesting upon receiving the RSU award. Review your company's specific terms to understand the options available to you.\n\nQ7: Is there a grace period during which no action needs to be taken after being awarded RSUs?\nA: Companies usually provide a \"cliff\" period where no actions need to be taken until a specified percentage of the total award has vested. For example, an employee may receive 100% of their RSU award only after 80% has vested. After reaching the cliff, the remaining unvested portion must be redeemed according to the vesting schedule. Always check your company's policy for details on the cliff period.\n\nQ8: Are there penalties associated with leaving the company before the full RSU award vests?\nA: In some cases, companies may impose partial forfeiture clauses, meaning that if an employee leaves before the entire RSU award vests, they may lose a proportion",

        "guidelines_completion_text": "\\nQ4: What happens when I sell my shares before vesting?\\\n A: Selling shares prior to vesting may result in a taxable event depending on the specific circumstances surrounding the sale. It is recommended that you consult with a tax advisor for personalized advice. Generally, any gains realized from selling vested shares would typically be subject to capital gains taxes. However, there could also be potential clawback provisions based on company policies regarding early sales of restricted stock units. Please review your company's policy and consult with a financial advisor for guidance tailored to your situation.\n\nFor further clarification, consider these questions:\n\nQ5: Are there any restrictions on how many RSUs can be sold at once?\nA: Yes, companies often have policies limiting the number of RSUs that can be sold within a certain time frame to prevent rapid dilution of existing shareholders' equity. These limits vary between organizations but should be outlined in your company's employee handbook or compensation plan documentation.\n\nQ6: Can an employee choose whether they want their RSUs to vest immediately or over several years?\nA: Typically, RSU vesting schedules are predetermined by the company's compensation plan. Some plans might allow employees to select different vesting schedules upon acceptance of the job offer; however, other plans require immediate vesting upon receiving the RSU award. Review your company's specific terms to understand the options available to you.\n\nQ7: Is there a grace period during which no action needs to be taken after being awarded RSUs?\nA: Companies usually provide a \"cliff\" period where no actions need to be taken until a specified percentage of the total award has vested. For example, an employee may receive 100% of their RSU award only after 80% has vested. After reaching the cliff, the remaining unvested portion must be redeemed according to the vesting schedule. Always check your company's policy for details on the cliff period.\n\nQ8: Are there penalties associated with leaving the company before the full RSU award vests?\nA: In some cases, companies may impose partial forfeiture clauses, meaning that if an employee leaves before the entire RSU award vests, they may lose a proportion",

      "final_completion_text": "\\nQ4: What happens when I sell my shares before vesting?\\\n A: Selling shares prior to vesting may result in a taxable event depending on the specific circumstances surrounding the sale. It is recommended that you consult with a tax advisor for personalized advice. Generally, any gains realized from selling vested shares would typically be subject to capital gains taxes. However, there could also be potential clawback provisions based on company policies regarding early sales of restricted stock units. Please review your company's policy and consult with a financial advisor for guidance tailored to your situation.\n\nFor further clarification, consider these questions:\n\nQ5: Are there any restrictions on how many RSUs can be sold at once?\nA: Yes, companies often have policies limiting the number of RSUs that can be sold within a certain time frame to prevent rapid dilution of existing shareholders' equity. These limits vary between organizations but should be outlined in your company's employee handbook or compensation plan documentation.\n\nQ6: Can an employee choose whether they want their RSUs to vest immediately or over several years?\nA: Typically, RSU vesting schedules are predetermined by the company's compensation plan. Some plans might allow employees to select different vesting schedules upon acceptance of the job offer; however, other plans require immediate vesting upon receiving the RSU award. Review your company's specific terms to understand the options available to you.\n\nQ7: Is there a grace period during which no action needs to be taken after being awarded RSUs?\nA: Companies usually provide a \"cliff\" period where no actions need to be taken until a specified percentage of the total award has vested. For example, an employee may receive 100% of their RSU award only after 80% has vested. After reaching the cliff, the remaining unvested portion must be redeemed according to the vesting schedule. Always check your company's policy for details on the cliff period.\n\nQ8: Are there penalties associated with leaving the company before the full RSU award vests?\nA: In some cases, companies may impose partial forfeiture clauses, meaning that if an employee leaves before the entire RSU award vests, they may lose a proportion"
