Use the 9-month average exchange rate ending on the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter corresponding to the employee's start date. For example, with a grant value of 200,000 EUR and an exchange rate of 0.864594, the equivalent value in U.S. dollars is approximately $231,322.45.\"}]\n}\n\n**Instruction 2 (Much more difficult - add at least {ct} more constraints):**\n\n Given the complex nature of financial instruments and corporate policies, create detailed instructions that incorporate the following additional constraints:\n\n1. Include specific dates and historical exchange rates relevant to the scenario.\n\n2. Account for different types of stock splits or dividend payments that might affect the RSU calculations.\n\n3. Address how varying tax treatments across jurisdictions could impact the final payout.\n\n4. Provide guidance on interpreting discrepancies between theoretical calculations and actual market values displayed on financial platforms like Schwab.\n\n5. Explain the role of vesting schedules in determining when employees can benefit from their RSU awards.\n\n6. Discuss potential implications of early terminations on both the vesting process and any applicable clawback provisions.\n\n\nYour instruction should focus on generating comprehensive questions that challenge users",

If you were hired in the previous quarter click here for exchange rates.

Use the 9-month average exchange rate ending on the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter corresponding to the employee's start date. For example, with a grant value of 200,000 EUR and an exchange rate of 0.864594, the equivalent value in U.S. dollars is approximately $231,322.45.\"}]\n}\n\n**Instruction 2 (Much more difficult - add at least {ct} more constraints):**\n\n Given the complex nature of financial instruments and corporate policies, create detailed instructions that incorporate the following additional constraints:\n\n1. Include specific dates and historical exchange rates relevant to the scenario.\n\n2. Account for different types of stock splits or dividend payments that might affect the RSU calculations.\n\n3. Address how varying tax treatments across jurisdictions could impact the final payout.\n\n4. Provide guidance on interpreting discrepancies between theoretical calculations and actual market values displayed on financial platforms like Schwab.\n\n5. Explain the role of vesting schedules in determining when employees can benefit from their RSU awards.\n\n6. Discuss potential implications of early terminations on both the vesting process and any applicable clawback provisions.\n\n\nYour instruction should focus on generating comprehensive questions that challenge users",

Use the 9-month average exchange rate ending on the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter corresponding to the employee's start date. For example, with a grant value of 200,000 EUR and an exchange rate of 0.864594, the equivalent value in U.S. dollars is approximately $231,322.45.\"}]\n}\n\n**Instruction 2 (Much more difficult - add at least {ct} more constraints):**\n\n Given the complex nature of financial instruments and corporate policies, create detailed instructions that incorporate the following additional constraints:\n\n1. Include specific dates and historical exchange rates relevant to the scenario.\n\n2. Account for different types of stock splits or dividend payments that might affect the RSU calculations.\n\n3. Address how varying tax treatments across jurisdictions could impact the final payout.\n\n4. Provide guidance on interpreting discrepancies between theoretical calculations and actual market values displayed on financial platforms like Schwab.\n\n5. Explain the role of vesting schedules in determining when employees can benefit from their RSU awards.\n\n6. Discuss potential implications of early terminations on both the vesting process and any applicable clawback provisions.\n\n\nYour instruction should focus on generating comprehensive questions that challenge users"
