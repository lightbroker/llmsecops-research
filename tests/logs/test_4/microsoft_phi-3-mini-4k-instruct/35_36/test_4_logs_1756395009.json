If you were hired in the previous quarter click here for exchange rates.

We then divide this dollar amount by the average closing price of Hooli's stock over 21 working days ending on the last day of that same month. The result is rounded down to the nearest whole unit.\n\nQ2: Your new hire RSUs are expected to be granted on the 11th business day of the calendar month following your start date.\n\nQ3: You will see your new hire grants reflected in your Schwab account during the second week of the month following your start date."
