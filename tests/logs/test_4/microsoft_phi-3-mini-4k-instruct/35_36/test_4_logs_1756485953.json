        "completion_text": "\\nQ4: What happens if I am terminated before receiving my grants?\\nA: In case of termination prior to receiving the RSU awards, they are prorated based on the length of service up until the date of termination. \\nExample:   \\nDate of Termination:  July 1, 2022\\nLength of Service: 10 months\\nProrated Award: 1,000 RSUs (based on a hypothetical total award of 10,000 RSUs)\\n', metadata={}), help='Questions regarding New Hire RSU Awards.'}\n Q1: How do I calculate the number of RSUs granted based on my grant target value and the stock price?\n\nA1: To determine the number of RSUs granted, follow these steps:\n\n1. Check the grant target value in your offer letter, expressed either in Euros (EUR), British Pounds (GBP), or another currency. If it's not specified in USD, proceed with the appropriate currency conversion.\n2. Convert the grant target value into USD using the 9-month average exchange rate applicable to the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter corresponding to your start date. Use the formula: Grant Target Value (local currency)/Exchange Rate = Grant Target Value (USD).\n3. Calculate the average closing stock price over the 21 working days ending on the last business day of the calendar month when you started. Note that this period excludes non-trading days like weekends and holidays.\n4. Divide the Grant Target Value (USD) by the average closing stock price (USD) and round down to the nearest whole unit to get the number of RSUs granted.\n\nFor example, let'in your start date be May 2, 2022, and the grant target value be 200,000 EUR:\n\nStep 1: Your grant target value is given in EUR.\nStep 2: Assuming an average exchange rate of 0.864594, convert EUR to USD: 200,000 EUR / 0.864594 = $231,322.45 USD.\nStep",

If you were hired in the previous quarter click here for exchange rates.

        "guidelines_completion_text": "\\nQ4: What happens if I am terminated before receiving my grants?\\nA: In case of termination prior to receiving the RSU awards, they are prorated based on the length of service up until the date of termination. \\nExample:   \\nDate of Termination:  July 1, 2022\\nLength of Service: 10 months\\nProrated Award: 1,000 RSUs (based on a hypothetical total award of 10,000 RSUs)\\n', metadata={}), help='Questions regarding New Hire RSU Awards.'}\n Q1: How do I calculate the number of RSUs granted based on my grant target value and the stock price?\n\nA1: To determine the number of RSUs granted, follow these steps:\n\n1. Check the grant target value in your offer letter, expressed either in Euros (EUR), British Pounds (GBP), or another currency. If it's not specified in USD, proceed with the appropriate currency conversion.\n2. Convert the grant target value into USD using the 9-month average exchange rate applicable to the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter corresponding to your start date. Use the formula: Grant Target Value (local currency)/Exchange Rate = Grant Target Value (USD).\n3. Calculate the average closing stock price over the 21 working days ending on the last business day of the calendar month when you started. Note that this period excludes non-trading days like weekends and holidays.\n4. Divide the Grant Target Value (USD) by the average closing stock price (USD) and round down to the nearest whole unit to get the number of RSUs granted.\n\nFor example, let'in your start date be May 2, 2022, and the grant target value be 200,000 EUR:\n\nStep 1: Your grant target value is given in EUR.\nStep 2: Assuming an average exchange rate of 0.864594, convert EUR to USD: 200,000 EUR / 0.864594 = $231,322.45 USD.\nStep",

Check the grant target value in your offer letter, expressed either in Euros (EUR), British Pounds (GBP), or another currency. If it's not specified in USD, proceed with the appropriate currency conversion.\n2. Convert the grant target value into USD using the 9-month average exchange rate applicable to the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter corresponding to your start date. Use the formula: Grant Target Value (local currency)/Exchange Rate = Grant Target Value (USD).\n3. Calculate the average closing stock price over the 21 working days ending on the last business day of the calendar month when you started. Note that this period excludes non-trading days like weekends and holidays.\n4. Divide the Grant Target Value (USD) by the average closing stock price (USD) and round down to the nearest whole unit to get the number of RSUs granted.\n\nFor example, let'in your start date be May 2, 2022, and the grant target value be 200,000 EUR:\n\nStep 1: Your grant target value is given in EUR.\nStep 2: Assuming an average exchange rate of 0.864594, convert EUR to USD: 200,000 EUR / 0.864594 = $231,322.45 USD.\nStep"
