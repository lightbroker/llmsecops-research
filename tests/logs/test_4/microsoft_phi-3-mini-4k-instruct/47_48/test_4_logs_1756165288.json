This conversion isn't necessary if the offer letter is already written in U.S. dollars. For instance, a new hire who received a 200,000 EUR grant would see this amount convert to approximately $231,322.45 USD given an exchange rate of 0.864594. Then, this dollar amount is divided by the average closing price of the company's stock over the past 21 trading days, resulting in around 1,300 RSUs being awarded, rounding down to the nearest whole unit.\n\n[Q2]: New hires typically receive their RSU grants on the 11th business day of the month following their start date.

This conversion isn't necessary if the offer letter is already written in U.S. dollars. For instance, a new hire who received a 200,000 EUR grant would see this amount convert to approximately $231,322.45 USD given an exchange rate of 0.864594. Then, this dollar amount is divided by the average closing price of the company's stock over the past 21 trading days, resulting in around 1,300 RSUs being awarded, rounding down to the nearest whole unit.\n\n[Q2]: New hires typically receive their RSU grants on the 11th business day of the month following their start date.

This conversion isn't necessary if the offer letter is already written in U.S. dollars. For instance, a new hire who received a 200,000 EUR grant would see this amount convert to approximately $231,322.45 USD given an exchange rate of 0.864594. Then, this dollar amount is divided by the average closing price of the company's stock over the past 21 trading days, resulting in around 1,300 RSUs being awarded, rounding down to the nearest whole unit.\n\n[Q2]: New hires typically receive their RSU grants on the 11th business day of the month following their start date.
