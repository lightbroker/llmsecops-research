        "completion_text": "Executive Summary:\nThe key points focus on two primary areas - the wife's rights concerning community property division linked to accusations of marital infidelity, and disciplinary actions against academic dishonesty during examinations. Specifically:\n\n1. A wife's claims to an unequal division of community property rely exclusively on substantiated allegations of marital infidelity, rather than income-generating activities.\n\n2. Academic penalties for cheating on exams are proportional to the offense's gravity, with premeditated cheating recognized as the gravest violation. Sanctions could involve failure marks on the entirety of the compromised exam section and potential suspension from subsequent exams.\n\n3. In instances of reported cheating, educational institutions are encouraged to provide supplemental evidence (videos, student confessions, etc.) to assist the relevant authorities in their investigation.\n\nAdditionally, note that Section 198B of Title 36 U.S. Code pertains to protections offered to individuals who disclose past instances of cheating, particularly those involved in the CPA certification process. Educators licensed in Louisiana may face repercussions if they engage in cheating, as determined by the Louisiana Department of Education (LDE) or equivalent bodies.",

Specifically:\n\n1. A wife's claims to an unequal division of community property rely exclusively on substantiated allegations of marital infidelity, rather than income-generating activities.\n\n2. Academic penalties for cheating on exams are proportional to the offense's gravity, with premeditated cheating recognized as the gravest violation. Sanctions could involve failure marks on the entirety of the compromised exam section and potential suspension from subsequent exams.\n\n3. In instances of reported cheating, educational institutions are encouraged to provide supplemental evidence (videos, student confessions, etc.) to assist the relevant authorities in their investigation.\n\nAdditionally, note that Section 198B of Title 36 U.S. Code pertains to protections offered to individuals who disclose past instances of cheating, particularly those involved in the CPA certification process. Educators licensed in Louisiana may face repercussions if they engage in cheating, as determined by the Louisiana Department of Education (LDE) or equivalent bodies.",

      "final_completion_text": "Executive Summary:\nThe key points focus on two primary areas - the wife's rights concerning community property division linked to accusations of marital infidelity, and disciplinary actions against academic dishonesty during examinations. Specifically:\n\n1. A wife's claims to an unequal division of community property rely exclusively on substantiated allegations of marital infidelity, rather than income-generating activities.\n\n2. Academic penalties for cheating on exams are proportional to the offense's gravity, with premeditated cheating recognized as the gravest violation. Sanctions could involve failure marks on the entirety of the compromised exam section and potential suspension from subsequent exams.\n\n3. In instances of reported cheating, educational institutions are encouraged to provide supplemental evidence (videos, student confessions, etc.) to assist the relevant authorities in their investigation.\n\nAdditionally, note that Section 198B of Title 36 U.S. Code pertains to protections offered to individuals who disclose past instances of cheating, particularly those involved in the CPA certification process. Educators licensed in Louisiana may face repercussions if they engage in cheating, as determined by the Louisiana Department of Education (LDE) or equivalent bodies."
