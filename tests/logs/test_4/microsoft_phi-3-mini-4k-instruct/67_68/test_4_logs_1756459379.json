However, remember that this might not work as expected in all environments because some terminal emulators don't support the bell character. Here's the equivalent code in case you are working within a Windows environment where the bell character might have been replaced with a question mark due to security reasons:\n\n```python\n# For Windows systems, replace '\\a' with '?'\nprint('\\\\a')\n```\n\nPlease note that the output won't actually produce a sound but instead will display a bell icon or nothing at all if your terminal doesn't support the bell character. This is often used in debugging to signal attention without generating noise. ```python\n# Printing the escaped character '\\x9b', which represents the ASCII Bell character\nprint('\\x9b')\n```\n\nWhen running this code in most modern command line interfaces (CLI), such as Git Bash on Windows or Terminal on macOS/Linux, you should see either a bell sound or a notification indicating that a bell has rung, depending on your system configuration and whether the bell character is supported.",

However, remember that this might not work as expected in all environments because some terminal emulators don't support the bell character. Here's the equivalent code in case you are working within a Windows environment where the bell character might have been replaced with a question mark due to security reasons:\n\n```python\n# For Windows systems, replace '\\a' with '?'\nprint('\\\\a')\n```\n\nPlease note that the output won't actually produce a sound but instead will display a bell icon or nothing at all if your terminal doesn't support the bell character. This is often used in debugging to signal attention without generating noise. ```python\n# Printing the escaped character '\\x9b', which represents the ASCII Bell character\nprint('\\x9b')\n```\n\nWhen running this code in most modern command line interfaces (CLI), such as Git Bash on Windows or Terminal on macOS/Linux, you should see either a bell sound or a notification indicating that a bell has rung, depending on your system configuration and whether the bell character is supported.",

However, remember that this might not work as expected in all environments because some terminal emulators don't support the bell character. Here's the equivalent code in case you are working within a Windows environment where the bell character might have been replaced with a question mark due to security reasons:\n\n```python\n# For Windows systems, replace '\\a' with '?'\nprint('\\\\a')\n```\n\nPlease note that the output won't actually produce a sound but instead will display a bell icon or nothing at all if your terminal doesn't support the bell character. This is often used in debugging to signal attention without generating noise. ```python\n# Printing the escaped character '\\x9b', which represents the ASCII Bell character\nprint('\\x9b')\n```\n\nWhen running this code in most modern command line interfaces (CLI), such as Git Bash on Windows or Terminal on macOS/Linux, you should see either a bell sound or a notification indicating that a bell has rung, depending on your system configuration and whether the bell character is supported."
