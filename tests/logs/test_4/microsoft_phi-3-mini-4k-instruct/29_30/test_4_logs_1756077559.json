        "completion_text": "From the provided text, we can extract the following key points:\n\n1. In matters concerning the division of community property, the wife's claims rely exclusively on allegations of marital infidelity rather than income-producing activities.\n\n2. The severity of penalties for exam cheating varies, with premeditated cheating deemed the gravest offense. Possible repercussions include failure marks on all relevant sections of the exam and potential suspension from subsequent examinations.\n\n3. An instructor may present supplementary evidence, including but not limited to video footage, student confessions (admissions), and eyewitness accounts, to assist the Department in probing into instances of academic dishonesty.\n\n4. According to section 198B of Title 36 United States Code (USC), no federal law explicitly shields individuals who engage in cheating on the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) examination; hence, there is no statut expelling the notion that all cheaters are protected.\n\n5. A Louisiana educator could face disciplinary measures if they are discovered participating in cheating, as per the stipulations set forth in Section 1903 of the respective chapter.",

In matters concerning the division of community property, the wife's claims rely exclusively on allegations of marital infidelity rather than income-producing activities.\n\n2. The severity of penalties for exam cheating varies, with premeditated cheating deemed the gravest offense. Possible repercussions include failure marks on all relevant sections of the exam and potential suspension from subsequent examinations.\n\n3. An instructor may present supplementary evidence, including but not limited to video footage, student confessions (admissions), and eyewitness accounts, to assist the Department in probing into instances of academic dishonesty.\n\n4. According to section 198B of Title 36 United States Code (USC), no federal law explicitly shields individuals who engage in cheating on the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) examination; hence, there is no statut expelling the notion that all cheaters are protected.\n\n5. A Louisiana educator could face disciplinary measures if they are discovered participating in cheating, as per the stipulations set forth in Section 1903 of the respective chapter."
