(b) Where the spouse of the disabled person has been found guilty of conjugal infidelity by a court having proper jurisdiction.\nCompletion: [Salient Summary]:\n- A Louisiana educator can face sanctions under the educator credential if involved in cheating activities as per §1903 of this chapter.\n\nExample 2:\nLastly, concerning the wife's claims regarding community property, those were based solely on allegations of marital infidelity rather than income-generating activities. A Louisiana educator may face disciplinary action if involved in cheating, as per §1903. Veterans' benefits won't be shared unfairly due to disabilities or spousal misconduct. In the Phil Ivey case, there was no finding of cheating\n\nExample 3:\n1.
