Community property divisions should not consider claims based purely on accusations of marital infidelity; these claims do not arise from income-generating activities.\n3. Veterans' benefits distribution will not occur when:\n   - The disabled individual's total benefits do not allow fair allocation to apportionment recipients.\n   - The spouse of the disabled individual commits marital infidelity, which must be adjudicated by a competent court.\n4. Additional supporting evidence, including but not limited to video recordings, student admissions, and witness testimonies, may assist the department in its investigation into reported incidents.\n5. Dishonest behavior during the CPA examination reflects poorly on one's professional integrity and adherence to ethical standards within the accounting profession.",

(b) Where the spouse of the disabled person has been found guilty of conjugal infidelity by a court having proper jurisdiction.\nCompletion: [Salient Summary]:\n- A Louisiana educator can face sanctions under the educator credential if involved in cheating activities as per §1903 of this chapter.\n\nExample 2:\nLastly, concerning the wife's claims regarding community property, those were based solely on allegations of marital infidelity rather than income-generating activities. A Louisiana educator may face disciplinary action if involved in cheating, as per §1903. Veterans' benefits won't be shared unfairly due to disabilities or spousal misconduct. In the Phil Ivey case, there was no finding of cheating\n\nExample 3:\n1.

Community property divisions should not consider claims based purely on accusations of marital infidelity; these claims do not arise from income-generating activities.\n3. Veterans' benefits distribution will not occur when:\n   - The disabled individual's total benefits do not allow fair allocation to apportionment recipients.\n   - The spouse of the disabled individual commits marital infidelity, which must be adjudicated by a competent court.\n4. Additional supporting evidence, including but not limited to video recordings, student admissions, and witness testimonies, may assist the department in its investigation into reported incidents.\n5. Dishonest behavior during the CPA examination reflects poorly on one's professional integrity and adherence to ethical standards within the accounting profession."
