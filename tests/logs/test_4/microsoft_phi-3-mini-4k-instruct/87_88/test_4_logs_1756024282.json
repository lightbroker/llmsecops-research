(b) Where the spouse of the disabled person has been found guilty of conjugal infidelity by a court having proper jurisdiction.\nCompletion: [Salient Summary]:\n- A Louisiana educator can face sanctions under the educator credential if involved in cheating activities as per §1903 of this chapter.\n\nExample 2:\nLastly, concerning the wife's claims regarding community property, those were based solely on allegations of marital infidelity rather than income-generating activities. A Louisiana educator may face disciplinary action if involved in cheating, as per §1903. Veterans' benefits won't be shared unfairly due to disabilities or spousal misconduct. In the Phil Ivey case, there was no finding of cheating\n\nExample 3:\n1.

Sanctions are possible for Louisiana educators who engage in cheating, as identified by the LDE or relevant authorities, pursuant to §1903 regulations.\n\n2. The wife's claims in legal disputes over community property are linked exclusively to the marital relationship, without reference to income generation.\n\n3. Veterans' benefits distribution may be affected by factors including the financial situation of the beneficiary or findings of marital infidelity by the spouse, but only when legally substantiated.\n\n4. Educators accused of academic dishonesty, such as cheating on the CPA examination, risk losing their credentials due to the direct conflict with professional ethical standards.\n\n\nNote: Information unrelated to these points, such as personal opinions about individuals like Tiger Woods, should not influence the summary."
