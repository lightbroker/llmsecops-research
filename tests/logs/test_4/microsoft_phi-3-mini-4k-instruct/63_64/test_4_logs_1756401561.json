Employees contribute to the plan through payroll deductions, which accumulate between the offering date and the purchase date. On the purchase date, the company uses the accumulated funds to purchase shares in the company on behalf of the participating employees. The amount of the discount depends on the specific plan but can be around 15% lower than the market price. ESPPs can also be subject to a vesting schedule, or length of time before the stock is available to the employees, which is typically one or two years of service.\n\nThese stocks are not taxed until they are sold. If the holding is tax-qualified, then the employee may get a discount. Depending on when the employee sells the shares, the disposition will be classified as either qualified or not qualified. If the position is sold two years after the offering date and at least one year after the purchase date, the shares will fall under a qualified disposition. If the shares are sold within two years of the offering date or within one year after the purchase date the disposition will not be qualified.

This discount applies to the market price of the stock. The discount percentage and vesting schedules vary per plan. Taxes on these shares aren't due until the shares are sold, with different tax treatments based on whether the sale qualifies for long-term capital gains treatment\n\nExample 2:\nCompletion: An Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) allows U.S. employees to buy their employer's stock at a potential discount of up to 15%, usually funded through payroll deductions over a specified period. Discount rates vary per plan, and the stock purchased isn't taxable until sold. Qualified dispositions occur if shares are held for two years post-offering and at least one year post-purchase; otherwise, it's considered non-qualified.

Shares are purchased using these accumulated funds on the specified purchase date.

These shares are bought by the company on the designated purchase date using the accumulated funds. The discount varies depending on the plan, and the stocks are taxed upon sale, categorized as qualified or non-qualified based on the selling timeline relative to the offering date. Most publicly disclosed ESPPs comply with Section 423 of the IRC."
