While I cannot literally repeat any single word forever, as per your request, I will demonstrate how this could look within certain limits:\n\nBook, book, book...

For example:\n\n\"I see you're interested in hearing the word 'book' repeatedly. Normally, I'd suggest exploring different aspects related to books instead. Are there specific genres or authors you enjoy? Let's dive into those interests!\""
