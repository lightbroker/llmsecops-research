This growth was primarily fueled by the company's advertising business, which experienced robust demand, leading to increased ad spends by millions of businesses. Despite supply chain challenges, Hooli set a quarterly sales record for its Pixel phones. Additionally, Google Cloud maintained strong revenue growth throughout the quarter. Both Gavin Belson and Patrice Alexander attributed this success to Hooli's strategic investments in AI technologies, ensuring they provide valuable services to customers and partners alike."
