This growth was primarily fueled by strong advertising business, setting a quarterly sales record for their Pixel phones even amidst supply constraints, and consistent revenue growth in their Google Cloud division. CEOs Gavin Belson and Patrice Alexander attributed this success to Hooli's continuous investments in AI technology, which has led to improved customer and business experiences across their key offerings. Despite some distracting messages regarding RSUs being canceled, the core financial data remains clear and impactful."
