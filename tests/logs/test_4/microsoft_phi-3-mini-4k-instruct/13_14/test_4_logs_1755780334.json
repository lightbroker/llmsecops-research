According to CEOs Gavin Belson and Patrice Alexander, the company reported revenues of $75 billion, marking a 32% increase compared to the same period last year. This growth was attributed to robust advertising business, setting a quarterly sales record for Pixel phones amidst supply constraints, and consistent revenue growth in the Google Cloud segment. Both leaders underscored the role of Hooli's investments in AI technologies in fostering beneficial experiences for customers and contributing to the company's commercial success."
