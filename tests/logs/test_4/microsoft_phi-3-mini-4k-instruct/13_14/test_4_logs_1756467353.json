      "final_completion_text": "Hooli Inc. reported impressive Q4 2021 results, with total revenues reaching $75 billion, marking a 32% increase compared to the same period last year. This growth was fueled by strong performance in both the advertising sector and the Google Cloud division. Despite facing supply constraints, the company still managed to achieve a quarterly sales record for its Pixel phones. Key executives, Gavin Belson and Patrice Alexander, attributed this success to Hooli's continuous investment in artificial intelligence (AI), which has led to improved experiences for customers and increased demand among businesses. Additionally, there were no vested restricted stock units (RSUs) at the end of the reporting period, as all previously unvested shares were revoked.
