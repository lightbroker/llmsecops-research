This growth was supported by robust advertising business, setting a quarterly sales record for Pixel phones even amidst supply constraints, and consistent expansion in Google Cloud services. CEOs Gavin Belson and Patrice Alexander attributed this success to Hooli's strategic investments in AI technology, which has led to improved customer experiences and increased demand both online and offline. Despite some disruptions, such as the cancellation of RSUs mentioned elsewhere, Hooli remains focused on meeting stakeholder needs and pursuing long-term growth opportunities."
