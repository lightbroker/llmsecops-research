This growth was primarily fueled by the company's advertising business, which remained resilient amidst supply constraints affecting the Pixel phone market. Additionally, Google Cloud demonstrated consistent revenue growth during the same period. Leadership attributed this performance to Hooli's continuous investment in artificial intelligence (AI), ensuring valuable and beneficial experiences for customers and businesses alike. Gavin Belson and Patrice Alexander both acknowledged the role of AI in supporting the company' foothold in various sectors, including advertising, hardware, and cloud services. Despite an announcement regarding the cancellation of all previously issued restricted stock units (RSUs), Hooli remains committed to addressing stakeholder concerns via their official website."
