This surge was attributed to strong growth in the advertising sector, setting a quarterly sales record for Pixel phones even amidst supply constraints, and consistent expansion in Google Cloud services. CEOs Gavin Belson and Patrice Alexander praised the company's dedication to AI technology and strategic investments, respectively, as key drivers behind these achievements. Despite an announcement regarding the cancellation of all unvested Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), the financial outlook remains promising based on the presented data."
