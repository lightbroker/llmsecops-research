During this period, they reported revenues of $75 billion, marking a 32% year-over-year increase. This growth was fueled by strong performance in their advertising business, setting a quarterly sales record for Pixel phones amidst supply constraints, and consistent growth in their Google Cloud division. CEOs Gavin Belson and Patrice Alexander attributed this progress to Hooli's strategic investments in AI technology and service delivery, respectively. Despite an announcement regarding the cancellation of all previously granted Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), the overall financial health and trajectory of Hooli remain promising based on the latest earnings report."
