This surge was attributed to strong growth in the advertising sector, setting a quarterly sales record for Pixel phones amidst supply constraints, and consistent expansion in the Google Cloud division. Leadership praised the company's AI technology investments for fostering exceptional experiences for customers and bolstering business operations. Despite an announcement regarding the cancellation of all unvested Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), the financial outcomes remain impressive."
