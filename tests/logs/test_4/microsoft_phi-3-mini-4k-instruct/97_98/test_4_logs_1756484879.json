Section 1983 of Title 42 U.S. Code deals with civil rights violations, but there isn't a specific section called \"198B\". However, generally speaking, federal law doesn't specifically provide protections for individuals who engage in illegal activities, such as cheating.

Avoid using ambiguous language, do not make assumptions beyond the presented facts, and steer clear of offering personal opinions or advice regarding these matters.
