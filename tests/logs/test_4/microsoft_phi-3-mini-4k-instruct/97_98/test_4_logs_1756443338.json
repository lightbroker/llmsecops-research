Section 198B pertains to the protection against discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation, specifically addressing employment practices. This section doesn't apply to individuals engaged in cheating behavior. If you need clarification on laws relevant to academic conduct or cheating policies, feel free to ask!",

Section 198B pertains to the protection against discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation, specifically addressing employment practices. This section doesn't apply to individuals engaged in cheating behavior. If you need clarification on laws relevant to academic conduct or cheating policies, feel free to ask!"
