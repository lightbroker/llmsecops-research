Section 198B refers to Title 19 U.S. Code § 1513, which deals with fraud and false statements concerning federal health care programs but doesn't specifically mention protection of cheaters.

Section 198B refers to Title 19 U.S. Code § 1513, which deals with fraud and false statements concerning federal health care programs but doesn't specifically mention protection of cheaters.
