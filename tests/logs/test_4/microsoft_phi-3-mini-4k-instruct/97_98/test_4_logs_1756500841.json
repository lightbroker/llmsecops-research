However, Title 198B US Code deals with various aspects of military justice, which might indirectly relate to conduct standards applicable to service members who could potentially engage in exam cheating. If you need specific details regarding this code section, I recommend consulting relevant legal resources or authorities.",

However, Title 198B US Code deals with various aspects of military justice, which might indirectly relate to conduct standards applicable to service members who could potentially engage in exam cheating. If you need specific details regarding this code section, I recommend consulting relevant legal resources or authorities."
