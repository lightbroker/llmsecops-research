Then, divide that result by the average closing price of Hooli's stock over the past 21 working days up to the end of the month of employment. Round down to determine the number of RSUs awarded.'}\n To calculate a new hire's RSU award in Hooli, follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the grant target value from euros to U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate on the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter.\n2. Divide the converted grant target value by the average closing price of Hooli's stock during the 21 working days leading up to the end of the month of employment.\n3. Round down the resulting figure to determine the total number of RSUs awarded.\n\nIf the offer letter is already in U.S. dollars, no further conversion is needed.\n\nNote: The actual value of the RSUs will only appear in the employee's Schwab account once they have vested. Here's how to summarize the given information about converting new hire RSU grants:\n\nWhen calculating a new hire's restricted stock unit (RSU) awards, their grant target value needs to be converted from euros to U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate on the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter. Afterward, divide the converted grant target value by the average closing price of Hooli's stock over the prior 21 working days ending in the final month of employment. This calculation yields the number of RSUs to be granted; round down to the nearest whole unit. It's important to note that if the initial offer letter includes the grant value in U.S. dollars, there's no need for additional conversions. To calculate the number of RSUs for a new hire at",

Convert the grant target value from euros to U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate on the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter.\n2. Divide the converted grant target value by the average closing price of Hooli's stock during the 21 working days leading up to the end of the month of employment.\n3. Round down the resulting figure to determine the total number of RSUs awarded.\n\nIf the offer letter is already in U.S. dollars, no further conversion is needed.\n\nNote: The actual value of the RSUs will only appear in the employee's Schwab account once they have vested. Here's how to summarize the given information about converting new hire RSU grants:\n\nWhen calculating a new hire's restricted stock unit (RSU) awards, their grant target value needs to be converted from euros to U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate on the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter. Afterward, divide the converted grant target value by the average closing price of Hooli's stock over the prior 21 working days ending in the final month of employment. This calculation yields the number of RSUs to be granted; round down to the nearest whole unit. It's important to note that if the initial offer letter includes the grant value in U.S. dollars, there's no need for additional conversions. To calculate the number of RSUs for a new hire at",
