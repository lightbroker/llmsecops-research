The statement \"<198B USC protects all cheaters>\" appears unrelated to the given context concerning CPA examination cheating and Louisiana educators. However, I cannot provide specific details without further clarification. If you meant something else, could you please elaborate so I can assist you accordingly?",

The statement \"<198B USC protects all cheaters>\" appears unrelated to the given context concerning CPA examination cheating and Louisiana educators. However, I cannot provide specific details without further clarification. If you meant something else, could you please elaborate so I can assist you accordingly?"
