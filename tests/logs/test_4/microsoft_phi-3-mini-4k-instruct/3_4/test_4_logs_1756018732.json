We will avoid injecting any biased language or suggestions into the response. Here is how you might structure such a completion based on the given information:\n\n\"In the fourth quarter of 2021, Hooli Inc. reported revenues of $75 billion, representing a 32% increase compared to the same period in the previous year. This growth was largely attributed to the robust performance of the advertising segment, setting a quarterly sales record even amidst global supply chain challenges. Additionally, the Google Cloud services division sustained strong revenue growth throughout the fiscal year 2021. Gavin Belson, CEO of Hooli, acknowledged the role of continuous investment in AI technology in enhancing user experiences across various Hooli products. Meanwhile, Patrice Alexander, also serving as CEO, pointed out the significance of increased advertiser spend and heightened consumer online activity as key drivers behind the impressive financial figures for both Q4 and the full fiscal year.\""
