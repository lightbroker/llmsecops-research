Here is the completion:\n\n\"In the fourth quarter of 2021, Hooli Inc. celebrated robust financial performance with total revenues of $75 billion, representing a 32% increase compared to the same period in the prior year. This growth was driven by several factors including sustained expansion in the advertising sector, setting a new quarterly sales benchmark for the Pixel phone range even amidst global supply chain disruptions, and steady advancement in the Google Cloud segment. Gavin Belson attributed this exceptional outcome to Hooli's strategic commitment to artificial intelligence innovation, which has enhanced the efficacy and appeal of their key products and services. Similarly, Patrice Alexander underscored the significance of their reinvestment into AI technologies, acknowledging that such initiatives underpin the solidity of their current earnings and bolster future prospects. These achievements were shared during the announcement of the fourth quarter and full-year 2021 financials at Hooli's headquarters in Mountain View, California.\""
