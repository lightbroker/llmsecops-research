This growth was supported by robust advertising business, setting a quarterly sales record for Pixel phones despite supply chain challenges, and sustained expansion in Google Cloud services. Gavin Belson attributed this success to Hooli's commitment to advancing AI technologies, enhancing customer experiences, and driving business innovation. Patrice Alexander noted the importance of healthy advertiser spend and consumer engagement alongside the company's continuous investments in cloud infrastructure.\""
