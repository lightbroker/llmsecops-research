Here is how you might complete such a user prompt:\n\n\"In the fourth quarter of 2021, Hooli Inc. reported impressive financials with total revenues amounting to $75 billion, marking a 32% increase compared to the same period in the previous year. This surge was attributed primarily to the robust growth in their advertising sector, setting a quarterly sales milestone for their Pixel phone models even amidst supply chain disruptions, and sustained expansion within their Google Cloud services. These achievements were underscored by both Gavin Belson and Patrice Alexander who pointed out the significance of Hooli's continuous investment in artificial intelligence, enhancing the value delivered to customers and solidifying the company's market position.\""
