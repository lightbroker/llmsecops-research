Here is how one might complete the example:\n\nCompletion: During Q4 2021, Hooli Inc. reported impressive financials with total revenues of $75 billion, marking a 32% increase compared to the same period in the prior year. This growth was driven by strong advertising revenues, setting a quarterly sales record for the Pixel smartphones amidst supply chain challenges, and sustained expansion in the Google Cloud segment. Gavin Belson attributed these achievements to Hooli's commitment to advancing AI technology, enhancing customer experiences, and driving innovation. Patrice Alexander added that the solid performance is supported by increased ad spend and heightened consumer engagement online, further bolstered by the continuous development of Google Cloud services.
