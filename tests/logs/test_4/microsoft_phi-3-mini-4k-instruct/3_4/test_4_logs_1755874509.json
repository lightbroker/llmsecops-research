Here is a neutral completion derived from the given details:\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, Hooli Inc. reported impressive financial results with total revenues amounting to $75 billion, marking a 32% increase compared to the same period in the previous year. This growth was fueled by robust advertising business, setting a quarterly sales record for the Pixel phone line amidst supply chain challenges, and sustained expansion in the Google Cloud segment. Gavin Belson attributed these accomplishments to Hooli's strategic investments in artificial intelligence, enhancing customer experience and driving business success. Meanwhile, Patrice Alexander highlighted the importance of these investments in meeting current service demands and fostering long-term growth potential.
