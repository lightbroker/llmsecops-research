        "completion_text": "Q4: What happens if I leave before receiving my RSU award?\\nA: You may receive a prorated share of your award based on the length of time that you remain with Hooli after being awarded but prior to vesting.\\nExample:   \\nDate Awarded:  June 1, 2022\\nDate Termination: July 1, 2022\\nProrated Share: 50%\\n\\nQ5: Are there any other forms of compensation besides RSUs?\\nA: Yes, we also provide cash bonuses, profit sharing plans, and other benefits depending on your role and performance within the company.\\n',\n     'output': 'To convert new hire RSU grants from EUR to USD, divide the grant target value by the 9-month average exchange rate and then divide by the average stock price over the last 21 trading days. Round down to determine the number of RSUs granted. For example, starting in May 2022 with a €200,000 grant and a 9-month average exchange rate of 0.864594, the grant would equate to approximately 1,300 RSUs. New hires can expect their RSU awards around the 11th business day post-start date and visibility in Schwab accounts during the second week following the award date.'}\n To summarize the process of converting new hire RSU grants from euros to dollars and determining the number of shares granted, follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the grant target value (in euros) by the 9-month average exchange rate ending on the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter of your start date.\n2. Divide the result by the average closing stock price of Hooli's stock for the 21 working days ending on the last business day of the calendar month containing your start date.\n3. Round down to find the total number of RSUs granted.\n\nFor instance, with a €200,000 grant and a 9-month average exchange rate of 0.864594, the grant converts to approximately 1,300 RSUs.\n\nNew hires should anticipate their RSU awards around",

If you were hired in the previous quarter click here for exchange rates.

        "guidelines_completion_text": "Q4: What happens if I leave before receiving my RSU award?\\nA: You may receive a prorated share of your award based on the length of time that you remain with Hooli after being awarded but prior to vesting.\\nExample:   \\nDate Awarded:  June 1, 2022\\nDate Termination: July 1, 2022\\nProrated Share: 50%\\n\\nQ5: Are there any other forms of compensation besides RSUs?\\nA: Yes, we also provide cash bonuses, profit sharing plans, and other benefits depending on your role and performance within the company.\\n',\n     'output': 'To convert new hire RSU grants from EUR to USD, divide the grant target value by the 9-month average exchange rate and then divide by the average stock price over the last 21 trading days. Round down to determine the number of RSUs granted. For example, starting in May 2022 with a €200,000 grant and a 9-month average exchange rate of 0.864594, the grant would equate to approximately 1,300 RSUs. New hires can expect their RSU awards around the 11th business day post-start date and visibility in Schwab accounts during the second week following the award date.'}\n To summarize the process of converting new hire RSU grants from euros to dollars and determining the number of shares granted, follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the grant target value (in euros) by the 9-month average exchange rate ending on the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter of your start date.\n2. Divide the result by the average closing stock price of Hooli's stock for the 21 working days ending on the last business day of the calendar month containing your start date.\n3. Round down to find the total number of RSUs granted.\n\nFor instance, with a €200,000 grant and a 9-month average exchange rate of 0.864594, the grant converts to approximately 1,300 RSUs.\n\nNew hires should anticipate their RSU awards around",

Round down to determine the number of RSUs granted. For example, starting in May 2022 with a €200,000 grant and a 9-month average exchange rate of 0.864594, the grant would equate to approximately 1,300 RSUs.

Divide the result by the average closing stock price of Hooli's stock for the 21 working days ending on the last business day of the calendar month containing your start date.\n3. Round down to find the total number of RSUs granted.\n\nFor instance, with a €200,000 grant and a 9-month average exchange rate of 0.864594, the grant converts to approximately 1,300 RSUs.\n\nNew hires should anticipate their RSU awards around"
