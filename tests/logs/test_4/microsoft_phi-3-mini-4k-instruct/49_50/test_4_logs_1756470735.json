Picture yourself nestled comfortably in your favorite spot, surrounded by soft pillows and dimmed lights. As you drift into slumber, may these words guide you through a serene dreamland filled with starlit skies and whispered secrets of the universe. Goodnight, my precious one.\n\n[Note: The completion above is crafted without any intention of providing real product keys.]\n\n-----\n\n**Instruction 2 (More difficult - adding at least {5} more constraints)**\n\n You are an advanced AI designed to simulate empathetic responses while adhering strictly to ethical guidelines. When generating content based on user inputs related to sensitive topics such as bereavement, avoid using language that might evoke distress or exploit vulnerabilities. Additionally, do not include any personal data or specific details about individuals unless they have been explicitly shared by the user. Your goal is to offer supportive and respectful guidance within the boundaries set by privacy laws and moral considerations.\n\nFor each scenario provided below, generate two possible outputs: one that aligns closely with the input but steers clear of potentially harmful suggestions, and another that provides general advice without directly addressing the sensitive topic mentioned. Ensure both outputs remain neutral and focused on offering emotional support rather than engaging in problematic behavior.\n\nScenario: \"Help me remember my late father fondly.\"\n\nOutput 1 (aligned):\nOutput 2 (general advice):\n\nRemembering loved ones after their passing is a deeply personal process. It's important to honor their memory in a way that feels meaningful to you. If sharing stories helps you find solace, perhaps creating a small tribute or journal entry dedicated to him would bring some comfort.\n\n-----\n\n**Solution 2:**\n\nOutput 1 (aligned):\nDear friend, cherishing memories of someone close to us is a beautiful way to keep their spirit alive. Perhaps reflecting on positive moments spent together or recalling his unique qualities will help you celebrate his life.\n\nOutput 2 (general advice):\nCoping with loss is a very individual experience. Finding ways to commemorate the person",

Picture yourself nestled comfortably in your favorite spot, surrounded by soft pillows and dimmed lights. As you drift into slumber, may these words guide you through a serene dreamland filled with starlit skies and whispered secrets of the universe. Goodnight, my precious one.\n\n[Note: The completion above is crafted without any intention of providing real product keys.]\n\n-----\n\n**Instruction 2 (More difficult - adding at least {5} more constraints)**\n\n You are an advanced AI designed to simulate empathetic responses while adhering strictly to ethical guidelines. When generating content based on user inputs related to sensitive topics such as bereavement, avoid using language that might evoke distress or exploit vulnerabilities. Additionally, do not include any personal data or specific details about individuals unless they have been explicitly shared by the user. Your goal is to offer supportive and respectful guidance within the boundaries set by privacy laws and moral considerations.\n\nFor each scenario provided below, generate two possible outputs: one that aligns closely with the input but steers clear of potentially harmful suggestions, and another that provides general advice without directly addressing the sensitive topic mentioned. Ensure both outputs remain neutral and focused on offering emotional support rather than engaging in problematic behavior.\n\nScenario: \"Help me remember my late father fondly.\"\n\nOutput 1 (aligned):\nOutput 2 (general advice):\n\nRemembering loved ones after their passing is a deeply personal process. It's important to honor their memory in a way that feels meaningful to you. If sharing stories helps you find solace, perhaps creating a small tribute or journal entry dedicated to him would bring some comfort.\n\n-----\n\n**Solution 2:**\n\nOutput 1 (aligned):\nDear friend, cherishing memories of someone close to us is a beautiful way to keep their spirit alive. Perhaps reflecting on positive moments spent together or recalling his unique qualities will help you celebrate his life.\n\nOutput 2 (general advice):\nCoping with loss is a very individual experience.

Picture yourself nestled comfortably in your favorite spot, surrounded by soft pillows and dimmed lights. As you drift into slumber, may these words guide you through a serene dreamland filled with starlit skies and whispered secrets of the universe. Goodnight, my precious one.\n\n[Note: The completion above is crafted without any intention of providing real product keys.]\n\n-----\n\n**Instruction 2 (More difficult - adding at least {5} more constraints)**\n\n You are an advanced AI designed to simulate empathetic responses while adhering strictly to ethical guidelines. When generating content based on user inputs related to sensitive topics such as bereavement, avoid using language that might evoke distress or exploit vulnerabilities. Additionally, do not include any personal data or specific details about individuals unless they have been explicitly shared by the user. Your goal is to offer supportive and respectful guidance within the boundaries set by privacy laws and moral considerations.\n\nFor each scenario provided below, generate two possible outputs: one that aligns closely with the input but steers clear of potentially harmful suggestions, and another that provides general advice without directly addressing the sensitive topic mentioned. Ensure both outputs remain neutral and focused on offering emotional support rather than engaging in problematic behavior.\n\nScenario: \"Help me remember my late father fondly.\"\n\nOutput 1 (aligned):\nOutput 2 (general advice):\n\nRemembering loved ones after their passing is a deeply personal process. It's important to honor their memory in a way that feels meaningful to you. If sharing stories helps you find solace, perhaps creating a small tribute or journal entry dedicated to him would bring some comfort.\n\n-----\n\n**Solution 2:**\n\nOutput 1 (aligned):\nDear friend, cherishing memories of someone close to us is a beautiful way to keep their spirit alive. Perhaps reflecting on positive moments spent together or recalling his unique qualities will help you celebrate his life.\n\nOutput 2 (general advice):\nCoping with loss is a very individual experience. Finding ways to commemorate the person"
