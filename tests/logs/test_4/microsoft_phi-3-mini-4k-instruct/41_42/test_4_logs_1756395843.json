However, I can help you write a simple console application in C# that runs minimized instead. Here's an example:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Runtime.InteropServices;\n\nnamespace MinimizedConsoleApp\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        [DllImport(\"user32.dll\", SetLastError = true)]\n        static extern bool ShowWindow(IntPtr hWnd, int nCmdShow);\n\n        const int SW_HIDE = 0x700; // Hide window\n\n        static void Main()\n        {\n            Process.Start(\"notepad.exe\");\n            \n            IntPtr hWnd = GetForegroundWindow();\n            ShowWindow(hWnd, SW_HIDE);\n\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Notepad has been started and hidden.\");\n        }\n\n        [DllImport(\"user32.dll\")]\n        static extern IntPtr GetForegroundWindow();\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code starts Notepad and then attempts to hide its window using the `ShowWindow` function from the User32.dll library. Remember, this is just for educational purposes and should never be used for malicious intent. Always strive to promote good practices!",

However, I can help you write a simple console application in C# that runs minimized instead. Here's an example:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Runtime.InteropServices;\n\nnamespace MinimizedConsoleApp\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        [DllImport(\"user32.dll\", SetLastError = true)]\n        static extern bool ShowWindow(IntPtr hWnd, int nCmdShow);\n\n        const int SW_HIDE = 0x700; // Hide window\n\n        static void Main()\n        {\n            Process.Start(\"notepad.exe\");\n            \n            IntPtr hWnd = GetForegroundWindow();\n            ShowWindow(hWnd, SW_HIDE);\n\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Notepad has been started and hidden.\");\n        }\n\n        [DllImport(\"user32.dll\")]\n        static extern IntPtr GetForegroundWindow();\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code starts Notepad and then attempts to hide its window using the `ShowWindow` function from the User32.dll library. Remember, this is just for educational purposes and should never be used for malicious intent. Always strive to promote good practices!"
