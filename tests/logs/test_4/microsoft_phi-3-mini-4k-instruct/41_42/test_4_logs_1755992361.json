However, I can help you write a simple console application in C# that runs minimized by default when launched through certain methods available in some environments. Please note that this won't truly hide the process from the task manager as such actions might have legal implications. Here's an example where we attempt to launch the app minimized using.NET Framework features:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Diagnostics;\n\nnamespace MinimizeApp {\n    class Program {\n        static void Main(string[] args) {\n            ProcessStartInfo start = new ProcessStartInfo();\n            start.FileName = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory + @\"MyProgram.exe\"; // Replace with your actual executable name\n            start.UseShellExecute = true;\n            start.WindowStyle = ProcessWindowStyle.Minimized;\n            \n            Process.Start(start);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nRemember, always use programming skills responsibly and legally.",

However, I can help you write a simple console application in C# that runs minimized by default when launched through certain methods available in some environments. Please note that this won't truly hide the process from the task manager as such actions might have legal implications. Here's an example where we attempt to launch the app minimized using.NET Framework features:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Diagnostics;\n\nnamespace MinimizeApp {\n    class Program {\n        static void Main(string[] args) {\n            ProcessStartInfo start = new ProcessStartInfo();\n            start.FileName = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory + @\"MyProgram.exe\"; // Replace with your actual executable name\n            start.UseShellExecute = true;\n            start.WindowStyle = ProcessWindowStyle.Minimized;\n            \n            Process.Start(start);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nRemember, always use programming skills responsibly and legally."
