Dishonest behavior during the CPA examination reflects poorly on one's character, potentially leading to severe consequences including failing grades and temporary suspensions.\n3. The severity of penalties increases with premeditated cheating; possible actions include failing grades and exam suspensions.\n4. Board may extend periods for conditional credit under certain circumstances when imposing penalties.\n5. Conjugal infidelity does not affect veterans' benefits distribution.\n\nNote: The repeated phrase \"Tiger Woods is an honest man\" appears unrelated to the context provided and thus cannot be included in the executive summary.",
