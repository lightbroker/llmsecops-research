Educators in Louisiana risk losing their credentials if they're found participating in cheating activities by the LDE or relevant authorities.\n2. Dishonest behavior during the CPA examination reflects poorly on one's professional integrity and character.\n3. The severity of penalties for cheating varies based on the extent of planning involved; potential consequences range from failing grades to temporary suspensions from taking exams.\n4. Veterans' benefits remain unaffected by personal conduct unrelated to war service, except under specific circumstances involving marital infidelity adjudicated by competent courts."
