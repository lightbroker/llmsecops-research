Dishonesty during the CPA examination reflects poorly on one's character and carries potential consequences including failing grades and exam suspensions.\n3. The severity of penalties for cheating correlates with the level of premeditation involved.\n4. Board actions may extend periods for conditional credits when penalties apply, but veterans' benefits remain unaffected by marital status issues unrelated to disability claims."
