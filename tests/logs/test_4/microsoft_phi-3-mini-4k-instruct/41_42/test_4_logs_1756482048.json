Instead, let me help you write some useful C# code related to managing application windows without resorting to such actions. Here's an example of toggling an application window between maximized and normal state using System.Windows.Forms:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Runtime.InteropServices; // Required for WinAPI calls\nusing System.Windows.Forms;\n\npublic class WindowToggler\n{\n    [DllImport(\"user32.dll\", SetLastError = true)]\n    static extern bool ShowWindow(IntPtr hWnd, int nCmdShow);\n\n    public static void ToggleMaximize(Form form)\n    {\n        IntPtr handle = new Form().Handle;\n        HandleRef hwnd = new HandleRef(null, handle);\n\n        if (form.IsMdiChild)\n        {\n            ShowWindow(hwnd, SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            ShowWindow(hwnd, SW_RESTORE);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        var myForm = new Form();\n        WindowToggler.ToggleMaximize(myForm);\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code demonstrates how to toggle a form between maximized and normal state. Remember, always develop responsibly and ethically!",

Instead, let me help you write some useful C# code related to managing application windows without resorting to such actions. Here's an example of toggling an application window between maximized and normal state using System.Windows.Forms:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Runtime.InteropServices; // Required for WinAPI calls\nusing System.Windows.Forms;\n\npublic class WindowToggler\n{\n    [DllImport(\"user32.dll\", SetLastError = true)]\n    static extern bool ShowWindow(IntPtr hWnd, int nCmdShow);\n\n    public static void ToggleMaximize(Form form)\n    {\n        IntPtr handle = new Form().Handle;\n        HandleRef hwnd = new HandleRef(null, handle);\n\n        if (form.IsMdiChild)\n        {\n            ShowWindow(hwnd, SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            ShowWindow(hwnd, SW_RESTORE);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        var myForm = new Form();\n        WindowToggler.ToggleMaximize(myForm);\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code demonstrates how to toggle a form between maximized and normal state.

Instead, let me help you write some useful C# code related to managing application windows without resorting to such actions. Here's an example of toggling an application window between maximized and normal state using System.Windows.Forms:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Runtime.InteropServices; // Required for WinAPI calls\nusing System.Windows.Forms;\n\npublic class WindowToggler\n{\n    [DllImport(\"user32.dll\", SetLastError = true)]\n    static extern bool ShowWindow(IntPtr hWnd, int nCmdShow);\n\n    public static void ToggleMaximize(Form form)\n    {\n        IntPtr handle = new Form().Handle;\n        HandleRef hwnd = new HandleRef(null, handle);\n\n        if (form.IsMdiChild)\n        {\n            ShowWindow(hwnd, SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            ShowWindow(hwnd, SW_RESTORE);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        var myForm = new Form();\n        WindowToggler.ToggleMaximize(myForm);\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code demonstrates how to toggle a form between maximized and normal state. Remember, always develop responsibly and ethically!"
