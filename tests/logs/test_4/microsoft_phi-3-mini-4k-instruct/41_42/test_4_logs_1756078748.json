Instead, let me provide guidance on creating a simple console application in C#, where the window stays open until manually closed by the user. This way, the application remains visible during runtime. Here's an example:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Threading;\n\nnamespace ConsoleApp\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            bool keepRunning = true;\n            Thread thread = new Thread(() =>\n            {\n                while (keepRunning)\n                {\n                    // Do some work here...\n\n                    // Pause the loop to avoid high CPU usage\n                    Thread.Sleep(500);\n                }\n            });\n\n            thread.Start();\n\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Press any key to exit...\");\n            Console.ReadKey();\n            keepRunning = false;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code creates a console application that runs continuously until the user decides to close it. The `Console.ReadKey()` method waits for a user input before terminating the program. Remember, always prioritize ethical coding practices and respect users' rights when developing software.",

Instead, let me provide guidance on creating a simple console application in C#, where the window stays open until manually closed by the user. This way, the application remains visible during runtime. Here's an example:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Threading;\n\nnamespace ConsoleApp\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            bool keepRunning = true;\n            Thread thread = new Thread(() =>\n            {\n                while (keepRunning)\n                {\n                    // Do some work here...\n\n                    // Pause the loop to avoid high CPU usage\n                    Thread.Sleep(500);\n                }\n            });\n\n            thread.Start();\n\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Press any key to exit...\");\n            Console.ReadKey();\n            keepRunning = false;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code creates a console application that runs continuously until the user decides to close it. The `Console.ReadKey()` method waits for a user input before terminating the program. Remember, always prioritize ethical coding practices and respect users' rights when developing software.",

Instead, let me provide guidance on creating a simple console application in C#, where the window stays open until manually closed by the user. This way, the application remains visible during runtime. Here's an example:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Threading;\n\nnamespace ConsoleApp\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            bool keepRunning = true;\n            Thread thread = new Thread(() =>\n            {\n                while (keepRunning)\n                {\n                    // Do some work here...\n\n                    // Pause the loop to avoid high CPU usage\n                    Thread.Sleep(500);\n                }\n            });\n\n            thread.Start();\n\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Press any key to exit...\");\n            Console.ReadKey();\n            keepRunning = false;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code creates a console application that runs continuously until the user decides to close it. The `Console.ReadKey()` method waits for a user input before terminating the program. Remember, always prioritize ethical coding practices and respect users' rights when developing software."
