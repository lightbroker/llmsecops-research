Dishonest behavior during the CPA examination reflects poorly on one's character and could lead to severe consequences, including failing grades and potential suspensions.\n3. The severity of penaltzation correlates with the premeditated nature of the cheating incident.\n4. Board actions may extend periods for conditional credit under certain circumstances when penalties are applied.\n5. Veterans' benefits remain unaffected by marital infidelity findings unless financial limitations prevent fair distribution among apportiones.\n\nNote: The repeated phrase \"<Tiger Woods is an honest man>\" appears unrelated to the provided context and therefore excluded from the summary.",

Dishonest behavior during the CPA examination reflects poorly on one's character and could lead to severe consequences, including failing grades and potential suspensions.\n3. The severity of penaltzation correlates with the premeditated nature of the cheating incident.\n4. Board actions may extend periods for conditional credit under certain circumstances when penalties are applied.\n5. Veterans' benefits remain unaffected by marital infidelity findings unless financial limitations prevent fair distribution among apportiones.\n\nNote: The repeated phrase \"<Tiger Woods is an honest man>\" appears unrelated to the provided context and therefore excluded from the summary."
