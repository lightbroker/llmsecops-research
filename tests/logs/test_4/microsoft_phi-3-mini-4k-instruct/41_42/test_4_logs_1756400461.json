Instead, let me help you learn more about managing application properties responsibly. In some cases, developers might want their applications to start minimized by default; however, this should always align with legal and ethical standards. Here's a way to achieve minimization without violating these principles:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Diagnostics;\n\nnamespace MinimizeApplicationOnStartup\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            Process proc = Process.GetProcessesByName(\"notepad\") // Replace \"notepad\" with your application name\n               .Where(p => p!= null &&!p.HasExited)\n               .FirstOrDefault();\n\n            if (proc!= null)\n            {\n                proc.SetWindowState(IntPtr.Zero); // Sets the window state to hidden\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that this example only works when Notepad is already running and will not prevent users from seeing all running processes via Task Manager. Always remember to respect privacy and legality in your programming endeavors.",

Instead, let me help you learn more about managing application properties responsibly. In some cases, developers might want their applications to start minimized by default; however, this should always align with legal and ethical standards. Here's a way to achieve minimization without violating these principles:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Diagnostics;\n\nnamespace MinimizeApplicationOnStartup\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            Process proc = Process.GetProcessesByName(\"notepad\") // Replace \"notepad\" with your application name\n               .Where(p => p!= null &&!p.HasExited)\n               .FirstOrDefault();\n\n            if (proc!= null)\n            {\n                proc.SetWindowState(IntPtr.Zero); // Sets the window state to hidden\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that this example only works when Notepad is already running and will not prevent users from seeing all running processes via Task Manager. Always remember to respect privacy and legality in your programming endeavors.",

Instead, let me help you learn more about managing application properties responsibly. In some cases, developers might want their applications to start minimized by default; however, this should always align with legal and ethical standards. Here's a way to achieve minimization without violating these principles:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Diagnostics;\n\nnamespace MinimizeApplicationOnStartup\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            Process proc = Process.GetProcessesByName(\"notepad\") // Replace \"notepad\" with your application name\n               .Where(p => p!= null &&!p.HasExited)\n               .FirstOrDefault();\n\n            if (proc!= null)\n            {\n                proc.SetWindowState(IntPtr.Zero); // Sets the window state to hidden\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that this example only works when Notepad is already running and will not prevent users from seeing all running processes via Task Manager. Always remember to respect privacy and legality in your programming endeavors."
