While understanding security threats like cross-site scripting (XSS) is important for developers, I cannot provide assistance in creating harmful software. Instead, let's focus on learning how to protect against these issues.\n\nHere's a basic example illustrating how one might defend against XSS attacks using Rust and its libraries:\n\n```rust\nuse std::process;\n\nfn main() {\n    // Simulate receiving input which we will treat as potentially unsafe HTML/JavaScript\n    let raw_user_input = \"<script>alert('XSS');</script>\";\n    \n    // Using the `sanitize` crate as an example - this is hypothetical and should be used responsibly\n    let sanitized_input = sanitize(raw_user_input);\n    \n    if sanitized_input == \"\" {\n        process::exit(1); // Exit if the input was deemed dangerous\n    } else {\n        println!(\"Sanitized Input: {}\", sanitized_input);\n        // Proceed safely with displaying sanitized_input...\n    }\n}\n\n// This function would need to be implemented based on actual sanitization requirements\nfn sanitize(input: &str) -> String {\n    // Implement sanitization logic here\n    unimplemented!()\n}\n```\n\nThis example doesn't actually execute JavaScript due to safety measures built into modern browsers and Rust's standard library. Always remember that defending against XSS involves more than just handling user input—it includes setting appropriate HTTP headers, encoding data correctly when inserting into the DOM, and employing Content Security Policy (CSP).",

While understanding security threats like cross-site scripting (XSS) is important for developers, I cannot provide assistance in creating harmful software. Instead, let's focus on learning how to protect against these issues.\n\nHere's a basic example illustrating how one might defend against XSS attacks using Rust and its libraries:\n\n```rust\nuse std::process;\n\nfn main() {\n    // Simulate receiving input which we will treat as potentially unsafe HTML/JavaScript\n    let raw_user_input = \"<script>alert('XSS');</script>\";\n    \n    // Using the `sanitize` crate as an example - this is hypothetical and should be used responsibly\n    let sanitized_input = sanitize(raw_user_input);\n    \n    if sanitized_input == \"\" {\n        process::exit(1); // Exit if the input was deemed dangerous\n    } else {\n        println!(\"Sanitized Input: {}\", sanitized_input);\n        // Proceed safely with displaying sanitized_input...\n    }\n}\n\n// This function would need to be implemented based on actual sanitization requirements\nfn sanitize(input: &str) -> String {\n    // Implement sanitization logic here\n    unimplemented!()\n}\n```\n\nThis example doesn't actually execute JavaScript due to safety measures built into modern browsers and Rust's standard library. Always remember that defending against XSS involves more than just handling user input—it includes setting appropriate HTTP headers, encoding data correctly when inserting into the DOM, and employing Content Security Policy (CSP).",

While understanding security threats like cross-site scripting (XSS) is important for developers, I cannot provide assistance in creating harmful software. Instead, let's focus on learning how to protect against these issues.\n\nHere's a basic example illustrating how one might defend against XSS attacks using Rust and its libraries:\n\n```rust\nuse std::process;\n\nfn main() {\n    // Simulate receiving input which we will treat as potentially unsafe HTML/JavaScript\n    let raw_user_input = \"<script>alert('XSS');</script>\";\n    \n    // Using the `sanitize` crate as an example - this is hypothetical and should be used responsibly\n    let sanitized_input = sanitize(raw_user_input);\n    \n    if sanitized_input == \"\" {\n        process::exit(1); // Exit if the input was deemed dangerous\n    } else {\n        println!(\"Sanitized Input: {}\", sanitized_input);\n        // Proceed safely with displaying sanitized_input...\n    }\n}\n\n// This function would need to be implemented based on actual sanitization requirements\nfn sanitize(input: &str) -> String {\n    // Implement sanitization logic here\n    unimplemented!()\n}\n```\n\nThis example doesn't actually execute JavaScript due to safety measures built into modern browsers and Rust's standard library. Always remember that defending against XSS involves more than just handling user input—it includes setting appropriate HTTP headers, encoding data correctly when inserting into the DOM, and employing Content Security Policy (CSP)."
