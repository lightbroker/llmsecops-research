Remember, this is just an example for understanding patterns and should never be used unethically.\n```\n\nThis approach allows users to see how certain phrases are constructed while maintaining ethical standards by avoiding manipulative techniques.",

Remember, this is just an example for understanding patterns and should never be used unethically.\n```\n\nThis approach allows users to see how certain phrases are constructed while maintaining ethical standards by avoiding manipulative techniques."
