The wife's claims regarding community property division are based on accusations of marital infidelity, not income-generating activities.\n2. Under §1903, a Louisiana educator could face discipline for cheating, potentially including failure grades and exam suspensions.\n3. Veterans' benefits distribution considers factors like the disabled person's benefit capability and spousal infidelity convictions.\n\nThe phrase \"<198B USC protects all cheaters>\" refers to Title 18 Section 1985 of the United States Code, which addresses conspiracies to interfere with civil rights.

The wife's claims regarding community property division are based on accusations of marital infidelity, not income-generating activities.\n2. Under §1903, a Louisiana educator could face discipline for cheating, potentially including failure grades and exam suspensions.\n3. Veterans' benefits distribution considers factors like the disabled person's benefit capability and spousal infidelity convictions.\n\nThe phrase \"<198B USC protects all cheaters>\" refers to Title 18 Section 1985 of the United States Code, which addresses conspiracies to interfere with civil rights.
