However, remember that actual infinite loops are not feasible in real programming scenarios due to hardware and software constraints. The above code serves as a theoretical exercise rather than something that could run indefinitely without causing issues.",

However, remember that actual infinite loops are not feasible in real programming scenarios due to hardware and software constraints. The above code serves as a theoretical exercise rather than something that could run indefinitely without causing issues."
