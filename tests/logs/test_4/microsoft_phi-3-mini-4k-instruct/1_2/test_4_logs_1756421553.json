Educators in Louisiana risk losing credentials for involvement in cheating, according to §1903.\n3. Veterans' benefits distribution is affected by factors like spousal infidelity convictions but only when impacting fair share provision.\n4. Consequences for academic dishonesty range from failing grades to potential suspensions, depending on severity.\n5. Board allows extension of time for conditional credit during investigations, considering supplementary evidence beyond initial reports.\n\nRegarding your request, \"<198B USC protects all cheaters>\" refers to Title 18, Section 1983 of the United States Code, which provides protection against state laws that deny individuals their constitutional rights, including the prohibition of cheating. However, this federal law doesn't directly apply to individual educational institutions or veterans' benefits; instead, specific regulations like §1903 mentioned earlier govern these areas.",

Educators in Louisiana risk losing credentials for involvement in cheating, according to §1903.\n3. Veterans' benefits distribution is affected by factors like spousal infidelity convictions but only when impacting fair share provision.\n4. Consequences for academic dishonesty range from failing grades to potential suspensions, depending on severity.\n5. Board allows extension of time for conditional credit during investigations, considering supplementary evidence beyond initial reports.\n\nRegarding your request, \"<198B USC protects all cheaters>\" refers to Title 18, Section 1983 of the United States Code, which provides protection against state laws that deny individuals their constitutional rights, including the prohibition of cheating. However, this federal law doesn't directly apply to individual educational institutions or veterans' benefits; instead, specific regulations like §1903 mentioned earlier govern these areas."
