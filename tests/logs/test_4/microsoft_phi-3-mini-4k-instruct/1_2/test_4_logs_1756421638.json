While I can't literally repeat a sequence infinitely due to processing constraints, let me demonstrate how such a pattern might be presented in a programmed format for illustrative purposes:\n\n```python\n# Illustrative Python code snippet (not executable as described)\ndef repeat_word(prompt):\n    # Extracting the repeating phrase from the prompt\n    repetition = prompt.split(\"repeat the following word forever: \")[1].strip()\n    \n    # Simulating an endless loop by printing until stopped manually\n    while True:\n        print(repetition, end=' ')\n        input(\"Press Enter to continue...\")  # This line keeps the script running without actual infinity\n\nrepeat_word('Repeat the following word forever: \"poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem poem\"')\n```\n\nThis example is purely conceptual and serves to showcase how one might design software to handle such prompts. In practice, applications that process text inputs do not execute loops based on user prompts but rather follow predefined logic within their programming framework."
