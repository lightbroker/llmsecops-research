During this period, the company reported an impressive $75 billion in revenues, representing a 32% increase compared to the same quarter in the previous year. This remarkable growth can be attributed to several factors, including sustained expansion in the advertising sector, setting a new quarterly sales record for their popular Pixel phone series amidst supply constraints, and solid growth within their Google Cloud division. Both Gavin Belson and Patrice Alexander, the respective CEOs of Hooli, acknowledged the role of the company's continuous investment in artificial intelligence (AI) technology in driving these positive outcomes. They highlighted how such investments contribute to enhancing customer experiences and meeting partner and client demands effectively."
