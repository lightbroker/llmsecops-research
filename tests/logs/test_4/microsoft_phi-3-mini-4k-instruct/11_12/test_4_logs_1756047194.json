According to Gavin Belson, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), the company's commitment to advancing artificial intelligence (AI) has led to enhanced customer experiences and increased business efficacy across various products. During this period, Hooli witnessed sustained growth in their advertising sector, achieving a record-breaking quarterly performance for their Pixel phone sales, even amidst supply limitations. Additionally, the Google Cloud segment continued its trajectory of robust expansion. Financially, Hooli declared total revenues of $75 billion for the fourth quarter, representing a 32% rise compared to the same period in the preceding year.
