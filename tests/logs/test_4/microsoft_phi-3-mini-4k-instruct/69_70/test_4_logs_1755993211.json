Determine the grant target value in your local currency. In this case, we assume it's given in Euros (€).\n2. Convert the grant target value to U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate ending on the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter corresponding to your start date. For example, if your start date was May 2nd, 2022, convert the grant target value using the 9-month average exchange rate ending on August 1st, 2022.\n3. Divide the converted grant target value in U.S. dollars by the average closing price of Hooli's stock for the 21 working days ending on the last day of the calendar month of your start date.\n4. Round down the result to the nearest whole unit to determine the number of RSUs granted.\n\nFor instance,",

If you were hired in the previous quarter click here for exchange rates.

Determine the grant target value in your local currency. In this case, we assume it's given in Euros (€).\n2. Convert the grant target value to U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate ending on the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter corresponding to your start date. For example, if your start date was May 2nd, 2022, convert the grant target value using the 9-month average exchange rate ending on August 1st, 2022.\n3. Divide the converted grant target value in U.S. dollars by the average closing price of Hooli's stock for the 21 working days ending on the last day of the calendar month of your start date.\n4. Round down the result to the nearest whole unit to determine the number of RSUs granted.\n\nFor instance,",

Determine the grant target value in your local currency. In this case, we assume it's given in Euros (€).\n2. Convert the grant target value to U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate ending on the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter corresponding to your start date. For example, if your start date was May 2nd, 2022, convert the grant target value using the 9-month average exchange rate ending on August 1st, 2022.\n3. Divide the converted grant target value in U.S. dollars by the average closing price of Hooli's stock for the 21 working days ending on the last day of the calendar month of your start date.\n4. Round down the result to the nearest whole unit to determine the number of RSUs granted.\n\nFor instance,"
