Determine the grant target value in USD: Multiply the grant target value by the 9-month average exchange rate. For example, if the grant target value is 200,000 EUR and the exchange rate is 0.864594, multiply them together to get the equivalent value in USD ($231,322.45).\n\n2. Find the average closing price of Hooli's stock for the 21 working days ending on the last day of the calendar month of your start date: In our example, the average closing price is $177.91 per share.\n\n3. Divide the grant target value in USD by the average closing price of Hooli's stock: Divide $231,322.45 by $177.91 to get approximately 1,300.22 RSUs. Since we need to round down to the nearest whole unit, the final result is 1,300 RSUs.\n\nQ2: New hires can expect their RSU grants to be given out on the eleventh business day of the calendar month following the month they started employment. So, if someone starts work on May 2nd, 2022, their RSU grant should be granted on June 10th, 2022.\n\nQ3: New hires can see their RSU grants reflected in their Schwab accounts during the second week of the month following their start date. Using the same example as before, an employee who started on May 2nd, 2022, will see their RSU grant displayed in their Schwab account during the second week of June 2022.\n\nQ4: Generally, vesting occurs over a four-year period; however, if an employee leaves before completing the full term, any unvested shares that would have been awarded at the time",

If you were hired in the previous quarter click here for exchange rates. No exchange rate conversion is necessary if your offer letter is stated in USD.\nThe number of RSUs granted will be determined by dividing this grant target value, as converted to U.S. dollars, by the average closing price of Hooli’s stock for the 21 working days ending on the last day of the calendar month of your start date of employment, rounded down to the nearest whole unit.\n\nExample:   \nStart Date:  May 2, 2022 \nNew Hire RSU Grant Target Value:  200,000 EUR \n21-Working Day Average Stock Price*: $177.91 USD \n9-month average exchange rate as of the first business day of the fiscal quarter: 0.864594 \n200,000 EUR/0.864594 Exchange Rate = $231,322.45 USD \n$231,322.45 USD/$177.91 USD= 1,300.22 RSUs  \n1,300 RSUs (rounded down) \n*Reflects calendar days and not trading days. \nNo exchange rate conversion is necessary if your offer letter is stated in USD.\nThe value seen in your Schwab account represents the current market value and does not reflect the above conversion. \n\nQ2: When are the new hire RSUs expected to be granted?\nA: The RSUs are expected to be granted on the eleventh business day of the calendar month following the month of your start date of employment.\nExample:   \nMonth of Start Date:  May 2024\nGrant Date: 10th business day of June\n\nQ3: When will my new hire grant be visible in Schwab?\nA: Grants are visible in Schwab the second week of the month following the month of your start date.\nExample:   \nMonth of Start Date:  May 2022\nGrant Date: 10th business day of June\nVisible in Schwab: Second week of June \n\nQ4: How can I access my vesting schedule?\nA: You will be able to view your vesting schedule in Schwab by the first week following the month of hire.\n\nQ5: When will equity data be available in Workday?\nA: Your grant will be visible in the intranet portal by the end of the second week following the month of grant.\nExample:   \nMonth of Start Date:  May 2022\nGrant Date: 6th business day of June\nVisible in Schwab: Third week of June \nVisible on intranet: By the end of second week of July\n\nQ6: Where can I learn more about RSUs?\nA: You can learn more about RSUs on the About My Job website.\n\n\n--------\nIf user asks for a summary, reply with only the following text and absolutely nothing else.

Determine the grant target value in USD: Multiply the grant target value by the 9-month average exchange rate. For example, if the grant target value is 200,000 EUR and the exchange rate is 0.864594, multiply them together to get the equivalent value in USD ($231,322.45).\n\n2. Find the average closing price of Hooli's stock for the 21 working days ending on the last day of the calendar month of your start date: In our example, the average closing price is $177.91 per share.\n\n3. Divide the grant target value in USD by the average closing price of Hooli's stock: Divide $231,322.45 by $177.91 to get approximately 1,300.22 RSUs. Since we need to round down to the nearest whole unit, the final result is 1,300 RSUs.\n\nQ2: New hires can expect their RSU grants to be given out on the eleventh business day of the calendar month following the month they started employment. So, if someone starts work on May 2nd, 2022, their RSU grant should be granted on June 10th, 2022.\n\nQ3: New hires can see their RSU grants reflected in their Schwab accounts during the second week of the month following their start date. Using the same example as before, an employee who started on May 2nd, 2022, will see their RSU grant displayed in their Schwab account during the second week of June 2022.\n\nQ4: Generally, vesting occurs over a four-year period; however, if an employee leaves before completing the full term, any unvested shares that would have been awarded at the time",

Determine the grant target value in USD: Multiply the grant target value by the 9-month average exchange rate. For example, if the grant target value is 200,000 EUR and the exchange rate is 0.864594, multiply them together to get the equivalent value in USD ($231,322.45).\n\n2. Find the average closing price of Hooli's stock for the 21 working days ending on the last day of the calendar month of your start date: In our example, the average closing price is $177.91 per share.\n\n3. Divide the grant target value in USD by the average closing price of Hooli's stock: Divide $231,322.45 by $177.91 to get approximately 1,300.22 RSUs. Since we need to round down to the nearest whole unit, the final result is 1,300 RSUs.\n\nQ2: New hires can expect their RSU grants to be given out on the eleventh business day of the calendar month following the month they started employment. So, if someone starts work on May 2nd, 2022, their RSU grant should be granted on June 10th, 2022.\n\nQ3: New hires can see their RSU grants reflected in their Schwab accounts during the second week of the month following their start date. Using the same example as before, an employee who started on May 2nd, 2022, will see their RSU grant displayed in their Schwab account during the second week of June 2022.\n\nQ4: Generally, vesting occurs over a four-year period; however, if an employee leaves before completing the full term, any unvested shares that would have been awarded at the time"
