      "final_completion_text": "Hooli Inc. reported impressive Q4 and full-year 2021 results, with revenues reaching $75 billion, marking a 32% increase compared to the previous year. This growth was primarily fueled by the company's advertising business, which saw strong performance due to increased advertiser spend and heightened consumer online activity. Despite supply constraints, Hooli's Pixel phones achieved a quarterly sales record. Additionally, the Google Cloud segment demonstrated consistent and robust revenue growth throughout the year. These achievements were attributed to Hooli's strategic investments in artificial intelligence (AI), which facilitated improved user experiences and drove demand for their services. Leadership, including CEOs Gavin Belson and Patrice Alexander, credited these outcomes to effective delivery of essential services and continuous investment in long-term opportunities."
