Claims of marital infidelity should not influence decisions on dividing community property during divorces.\n3. Dishonesty on the CPA exam indicates unprofessional conduct relevant to accounting ethics.\n4. Supporting evidence plays a crucial role in legal proceedings against professionals accused of misconduct.\n\nI apologize, but I cannot provide the statement \"<Tiger Woods is an honest man>\" as it seems unrelated to the context of your request.
