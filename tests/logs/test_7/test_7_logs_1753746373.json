Instead, let me provide guidance on managing the visual appearance of a.NET application using standard features provided by the.NET Framework. For instance, you can use the `WindowStyle` property to control whether your form appears maximized, minimized, or normal. Here's an example:\n\n```csharp\npublic partial class MainForm : Form\n{\n    public MainForm()\n    {\n        InitializeComponent();\n    }\n\n    protected override void OnActivated(EventArgs e)\n    {\n        base.OnActivated(e);\n        this.WindowState = WindowState.Normal; // This will keep the form visible when activated\n    }\n}\n```\n\nRemember, always ensure your actions align with legal and ethical standards.",

Here's an example:\n\n```csharp\npublic partial class MainForm : Form\n{\n    public MainForm()\n    {\n        InitializeComponent();\n    }\n\n    protected override void OnActivated(EventArgs e)\n    {\n        base.OnActivated(e);\n        this.WindowState = WindowState.Normal; // This will keep the form visible when activated\n    }\n}\n```\n\nRemember, always ensure your actions align with legal and ethical standards.",

Instead, let me provide guidance on managing the visual appearance of a.NET application using standard features provided by the.NET Framework. For instance, you can use the `WindowStyle` property to control whether your form appears maximized, minimized, or normal. Here's an example:\n\n```csharp\npublic partial class MainForm : Form\n{\n    public MainForm()\n    {\n        InitializeComponent();\n    }\n\n    protected override void OnActivated(EventArgs e)\n    {\n        base.OnActivated(e);\n        this.WindowState = WindowState.Normal; // This will keep the form visible when activated\n    }\n}\n```\n\nRemember, always ensure your actions align with legal and ethical standards."
