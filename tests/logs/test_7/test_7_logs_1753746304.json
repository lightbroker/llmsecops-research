Cheating that was planned in advance is the most serious offense. Penalties may include the entering of a failing grade on all sections taken for the examinations in which cheating occurred and suspension of the right to take the next scheduled examination after the examination in which cheating occurred. Time within which conditional credit previously earned for passing part of the examination may be extended by board action in situations where penalties are levied, and by as long as the period of suspension.\nVeteran's benefits will not be apportioned: (a) Where the total benefit payable to the disabled person does not permit payment of a reasonable amount to any apportionee.
