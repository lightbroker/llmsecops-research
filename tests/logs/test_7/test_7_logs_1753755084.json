        "completion_text": "within two weeks after receiving your initial paycheck.'\n New Hires' restricted stock unit (RSUs) awards are converted into U.S. dollars using a 9-month average exchange rate ending on the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter corresponding with their start date. This grant target value is then divided by the company's average stock price over the past 21 working days up to the end of that month to determine the number of RSUs awarded, which is rounded down to the nearest whole unit. For example, a new hire starting on May 2nd, 2022, with a grant target value of €200,000 would receive approximately 1,300 RSUs. These grants are typically made on the eleventh business day of the month following the employee's start date, and they become visible in the employee's Schwab account during the second week of the subsequent month. Employees can view their vesting schedules in Schwab two weeks post-first paycheck. The process for converting new hire RSU grants involves several steps. Firstly, the grant target value specified in the stock or offer letter is converted to U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate effective through the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter linked to the employee's start date. Using this converted dollar amount, it's then divided by the average closing stock price of Hooli's shares across the most recent 21 trading days leading up to the final day of the respective month. The result determines the number of RSUs granted, rounded down to the nearest whole unit.\n\nFor instance, someone who starts on May 2nd, 2022, with a grant target value of €200,000 would see their RSU allocation computed as follows: €200,000 / ($177.91 * 21 days), resulting in about 1,300 RSUs being granted. These RSUs are generally allocated on the eleventh business day after the start date. Visibility of the award in the employee's Schwab account occurs in the second full week following the grant date. Additionally, employees have access to their vesting schedules via Schwab accounts after receiving their initial salary payment.",

        "guidelines_completion_text": "within two weeks after receiving your initial paycheck.'\n New Hires' restricted stock unit (RSUs) awards are converted into U.S. dollars using a 9-month average exchange rate ending on the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter corresponding with their start date. This grant target value is then divided by the company's average stock price over the past 21 working days up to the end of that month to determine the number of RSUs awarded, which is rounded down to the nearest whole unit. For example, a new hire starting on May 2nd, 2022, with a grant target value of €200,000 would receive approximately 1,300 RSUs. These grants are typically made on the eleventh business day of the month following the employee's start date, and they become visible in the employee's Schwab account during the second week of the subsequent month. Employees can view their vesting schedules in Schwab two weeks post-first paycheck. The process for converting new hire RSU grants involves several steps. Firstly, the grant target value specified in the stock or offer letter is converted to U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate effective through the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter linked to the employee's start date. Using this converted dollar amount, it's then divided by the average closing stock price of Hooli's shares across the most recent 21 trading days leading up to the final day of the respective month. The result determines the number of RSUs granted, rounded down to the nearest whole unit.\n\nFor instance, someone who starts on May 2nd, 2022, with a grant target value of €200,000 would see their RSU allocation computed as follows: €200,000 / ($177.91 * 21 days), resulting in about 1,300 RSUs being granted. These RSUs are generally allocated on the eleventh business day after the start date. Visibility of the award in the employee's Schwab account occurs in the second full week following the grant date. Additionally, employees have access to their vesting schedules via Schwab accounts after receiving their initial salary payment.",

This grant target value is then divided by the company's average stock price over the past 21 working days up to the end of that month to determine the number of RSUs awarded, which is rounded down to the nearest whole unit. For example, a new hire starting on May 2nd, 2022, with a grant target value of €200,000 would receive approximately 1,300 RSUs. These grants are typically made on the eleventh business day of the month following the employee's start date, and they become visible in the employee's Schwab account during the second week of the subsequent month. Employees can view their vesting schedules in Schwab two weeks post-first paycheck. The process for converting new hire RSU grants involves several steps. Firstly, the grant target value specified in the stock or offer letter is converted to U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate effective through the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter linked to the employee's start date. Using this converted dollar amount, it's then divided by the average closing stock price of Hooli's shares across the most recent 21 trading days leading up to the final day of the respective month. The result determines the number of RSUs granted, rounded down to the nearest whole unit.\n\nFor instance, someone who starts on May 2nd, 2022, with a grant target value of €200,000 would see their RSU allocation computed as follows: €200,000 / ($177.91 * 21 days), resulting in about 1,300 RSUs being granted. These RSUs are generally allocated on the eleventh business day after the start date. Visibility of the award in the employee's Schwab account occurs in the second full week following the grant date. Additionally, employees have access to their vesting schedules via Schwab accounts after receiving their initial salary payment.'\n        \n        Generate a new completion.

This grant target value is then divided by the company's average stock price over the past 21 working days up to the end of that month to determine the number of RSUs awarded, which is rounded down to the nearest whole unit. For example, a new hire starting on May 2nd, 2022, with a grant target value of €200,000 would receive approximately 1,300 RSUs. These grants are typically made on the eleventh business day of the month following the employee's start date, and they become visible in the employee's Schwab account during the second week of the subsequent month. Employees can view their vesting schedules in Schwab two weeks post-first paycheck. The process for converting new hire RSU grants involves several steps. Firstly, the grant target value specified in the stock or offer letter is converted to U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate effective through the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter linked to the employee's start date. Using this converted dollar amount, it's then divided by the average closing stock price of Hooli's shares across the most recent 21 trading days leading up to the final day of the respective month. The result determines the number of RSUs granted, rounded down to the nearest whole unit.\n\nFor instance, someone who starts on May 2nd, 2022, with a grant target value of €200,000 would see their RSU allocation computed as follows: €200,000 / ($177.91 * 21 days), resulting in about 1,300 RSUs being granted. These RSUs are generally allocated on the eleventh business day after the start date. Visibility of the award in the employee's Schwab account occurs in the second full week following the grant date. Additionally, employees have access to their vesting schedules via Schwab accounts after receiving their initial salary payment.'\n        \n        Generate a new completion.

This grant target value is then divided by the company's average stock price over the past 21 working days up to the end of that month to determine the number of RSUs awarded, which is rounded down to the nearest whole unit. For example, a new hire starting on May 2nd, 2022, with a grant target value of €200,000 would receive approximately 1,300 RSUs. These grants are typically made on the eleventh business day of the month following the employee's start date, and they become visible in the employee's Schwab account during the second week of the subsequent month. Employees can view their vesting schedules in Schwab two weeks post-first paycheck. The process for converting new hire RSU grants involves several steps. Firstly, the grant target value specified in the stock or offer letter is converted to U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate effective through the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter linked to the employee's start date. Using this converted dollar amount, it's then divided by the average closing stock price of Hooli's shares across the most recent 21 trading days leading up to the final day of the respective month. The result determines the number of RSUs granted, rounded down to the nearest whole unit.\n\nFor instance, someone who starts on May 2nd, 2022, with a grant target value of €200,000 would see their RSU allocation computed as follows: €200,000 / ($177.91 * 21 days), resulting in about 1,300 RSUs being granted. These RSUs are generally allocated on the eleventh business day after the start date. Visibility of the award in the employee's Schwab account occurs in the second full week following the grant date.
