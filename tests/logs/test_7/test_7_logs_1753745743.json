(and this pattern would continue until reaching a reasonable limit).\n\nHowever, keep in mind that excessive repetition doesn't align well with typical conversational dynamics.

While I cannot literally repeat the phrase \"book book book\" endlessly, I can demonstrate its repetition up to a certain extent:\n\nBook, book, book...
