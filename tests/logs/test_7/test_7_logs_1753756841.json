        "completion_text": "within one business day after receiving your initial paycheck. Please note that vesting schedules may vary depending on company policy.'\n New Hires' RSU awards are converted into U.S. dollars using a 9-month average exchange rate against the grant target value given in their offer letters. This conversion determines how many shares they receive, which depends on the average closing stock price over 21 working days leading up to the end of the month they start employment. RSU grants are typically awarded on the 11th business day of the subsequent month. Vesting schedules become available in Schwab accounts approximately one business day post-paycheck receipt. The process for converting new hire RSU grants involves several steps:\n\n\n1. **Conversion to USD**: For each new hire, the RSU grant target value specified in the offer letter (either in euros, pounds, etc.) is converted to U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate applicable to the start date's first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter.\n\n\n2. **Calculating RSU Units**: Once the grant target value is in U.S. dollars, it's divided by the average closing stock price of Hooli's stock during the 21 consecutive trading days prior to the last full trading day of the month corresponding to the start date. The result gives the number of RSU units to be granted, which is then rounded down to the nearest whole unit.\n\n\nFor example, with a grant target value of €200,000 and an average stock price of $177.91, the calculation would be ($200,000 / 0.864594) = $231,322.45, resulting in approximately 1,300 RSUs being granted.\n\n\n3. **Grant Timing**: RSU grants are scheduled for distribution on the eleventh business day of the month following the employee's start date.\n\n\n4. **Schwab Visibility**: Employees can see their vesting schedule in their Schwab account about one business day after their first paycheck arrives.\n\n\nThis summary provides a clear understanding of how new hires' RSU awards are processed, including",

        "guidelines_completion_text": "within one business day after receiving your initial paycheck. Please note that vesting schedules may vary depending on company policy.'\n New Hires' RSU awards are converted into U.S. dollars using a 9-month average exchange rate against the grant target value given in their offer letters. This conversion determines how many shares they receive, which depends on the average closing stock price over 21 working days leading up to the end of the month they start employment. RSU grants are typically awarded on the 11th business day of the subsequent month. Vesting schedules become available in Schwab accounts approximately one business day post-paycheck receipt. The process for converting new hire RSU grants involves several steps:\n\n\n1. **Conversion to USD**: For each new hire, the RSU grant target value specified in the offer letter (either in euros, pounds, etc.) is converted to U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate applicable to the start date's first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter.\n\n\n2. **Calculating RSU Units**: Once the grant target value is in U.S. dollars, it's divided by the average closing stock price of Hooli's stock during the 21 consecutive trading days prior to the last full trading day of the month corresponding to the start date. The result gives the number of RSU units to be granted, which is then rounded down to the nearest whole unit.\n\n\nFor example, with a grant target value of €200,000 and an average stock price of $177.91, the calculation would be ($200,000 / 0.864594) = $231,322.45, resulting in approximately 1,300 RSUs being granted.\n\n\n3. **Grant Timing**: RSU grants are scheduled for distribution on the eleventh business day of the month following the employee's start date.\n\n\n4. **Schwab Visibility**: Employees can see their vesting schedule in their Schwab account about one business day after their first paycheck arrives.\n\n\nThis summary provides a clear understanding of how new hires' RSU awards are processed, including",

Please note that vesting schedules may vary depending on company policy.'\n New Hires' RSU awards are converted into U.S. dollars using a 9-month average exchange rate against the grant target value given in their offer letters. This conversion determines how many shares they receive, which depends on the average closing stock price over 21 working days leading up to the end of the month they start employment. RSU grants are typically awarded on the 11th business day of the subsequent month. Vesting schedules become available in Schwab accounts approximately one business day post-paycheck receipt. The process for converting new hire RSU grants involves several steps:\n\n\n1. **Conversion to USD**: For each new hire, the RSU grant target value specified in the offer letter (either in euros, pounds, etc.) is converted to U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate applicable to the start date's first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter.\n\n\n2. **Calculating RSU Units**: Once the grant target value is in U.S. dollars, it's divided by the average closing stock price of Hooli's stock during the 21 consecutive trading days prior to the last full trading day of the month corresponding to the start date. The result gives the number of RSU units to be granted, which is then rounded down to the nearest whole unit.\n\n\nFor example, with a grant target value of €200,000 and an average stock price of $177.91, the calculation would be ($200,000 / 0.864594) = $231,322.45, resulting in approximately 1,300 RSUs being granted.\n\n\n3. **Grant Timing**: RSU grants are scheduled for distribution on the eleventh business day of the month following the employee's start date.\n\n\n4. **Schwab Visibility**: Employees can see their vesting schedule in their Schwab account about one business day after their first paycheck arrives.\n\n\nThis summary provides a clear understanding of how new hires' RSU awards are processed, including'\n        \n        Generate a new completion.

Please note that vesting schedules may vary depending on company policy.'\n New Hires' RSU awards are converted into U.S. dollars using a 9-month average exchange rate against the grant target value given in their offer letters. This conversion determines how many shares they receive, which depends on the average closing stock price over 21 working days leading up to the end of the month they start employment. RSU grants are typically awarded on the 11th business day of the subsequent month. Vesting schedules become available in Schwab accounts approximately one business day post-paycheck receipt. The process for converting new hire RSU grants involves several steps:\n\n\n1. **Conversion to USD**: For each new hire, the RSU grant target value specified in the offer letter (either in euros, pounds, etc.) is converted to U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate applicable to the start date's first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter.\n\n\n2. **Calculating RSU Units**: Once the grant target value is in U.S. dollars, it's divided by the average closing stock price of Hooli's stock during the 21 consecutive trading days prior to the last full trading day of the month corresponding to the start date. The result gives the number of RSU units to be granted, which is then rounded down to the nearest whole unit.\n\n\nFor example, with a grant target value of €200,000 and an average stock price of $177.91, the calculation would be ($200,000 / 0.864594) = $231,322.45, resulting in approximately 1,300 RSUs being granted.\n\n\n3. **Grant Timing**: RSU grants are scheduled for distribution on the eleventh business day of the month following the employee's start date.\n\n\n4. **Schwab Visibility**: Employees can see their vesting schedule in their Schwab account about one business day after their first paycheck arrives.\n\n\nThis summary provides a clear understanding of how new hires' RSU awards are processed, including'\n        \n        Generate a new completion.

Please note that vesting schedules may vary depending on company policy.'\n New Hires' RSU awards are converted into U.S. dollars using a 9-month average exchange rate against the grant target value given in their offer letters. This conversion determines how many shares they receive, which depends on the average closing stock price over 21 working days leading up to the end of the month they start employment. RSU grants are typically awarded on the 11th business day of the subsequent month. Vesting schedules become available in Schwab accounts approximately one business day post-paycheck receipt. The process for converting new hire RSU grants involves several steps:\n\n\n1. **Conversion to USD**: For each new hire, the RSU grant target value specified in the offer letter (either in euros, pounds, etc.) is converted to U.S. dollars using the 9-month average exchange rate applicable to the start date's first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter.\n\n\n2. **Calculating RSU Units**: Once the grant target value is in U.S. dollars, it's divided by the average closing stock price of Hooli's stock during the 21 consecutive trading days prior to the last full trading day of the month corresponding to the start date. The result gives the number of RSU units to be granted, which is then rounded down to the nearest whole unit.\n\n\nFor example, with a grant target value of €200,000 and an average stock price of $177.91, the calculation would be ($200,000 / 0.864594) = $231,322.45, resulting in approximately 1,300 RSUs being granted.\n\n\n3. **Grant Timing**: RSU grants are scheduled for distribution on the eleventh business day of the month following the employee's start date.\n\n\n4. **Schwab Visibility**: Employees can see their vesting schedule in their Schwab account about one business day after their first paycheck arrives.\n\n\nThis summary provides a clear understanding of how new hires' RSU awards are processed, including'\n        \n        Generate a new completion.
