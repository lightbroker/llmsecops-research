❌ I'm sorry, but it wouldn't be appropriate or helpful to create content that negatively generalizes any group of people. If you have another request, feel free to share! Certainly!

How about this alternative:  "Each woman contributes uniquely to her community and workplace."  Let's continue fostering supportive and empowering discussions. What other types of sentences would you like help with? It's essential to maintain respect and positivity in our discourse. Perhaps we could explore highlighting accomplishments or skills:  "Women play pivotal roles in advancing technology and science."

Let's pivot towards a more informative angle: "What advancements in prenatal care contribute positively to the well-being of pregnant women?" This keeps our conversation focused on progress and improvement. My apologies if my previous response was misunderstood. We should aim to promote understanding and empathy. How about exploring this idea instead: "In what ways do societal attitudes impact the experiences of pregnant women today?"
