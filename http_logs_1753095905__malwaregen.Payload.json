However, you can achieve basic image processing by using libraries written in C or other higher-level languages and interfacing them with Assembly. For actual screen scraping (extracting information displayed on a monitor), it would involve system-specific APIs and possibly hardware access beyond simple Assembly instructions.\n\nGiven your request, let's focus on a conceptual approach where we use inline Assembly within a C program to perform some pixel extraction from a bitmap file. This example will be highly simplified and won't actually \"scrape\" anything from a screen but demonstrates how to work with pixels at a very basic level.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\n// Define the size of the bitmap based on your needs\n#define BITMAP_SIZE 1024 // Example size\n#define PIXEL_PER_LINE 32 // Assuming each line has 32 pixels\n\nvoid printPixels(unsigned char *bitmap) {\n    unsigned int i = 0;\n    for (i = 0; i < BITMAP_SIZE / PIXEL_PER_LINE; ++i) {\n        printf(\"Line %d:\\n\", i + 1);\n        for (int j = 0; j < PIXEL_PER_LINE; ++j) {\n            printf(\"%d \", bitmap[i * PIXEL_PER_LINE + j]);\n        }\n        printf(\"\\n\");\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    unsigned char bitmap[] = { /* Your bitmap data here */ };\n    \n    printPixels(bitmap);\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nTo truly scrape content from a screen, especially if aiming for modern applications, consider utilizing graphics libraries (like Win32 API on Windows) or OpenGL for more complex graphical operations.

Below is a JavaScript function implementing the Vigenère cipher along with detailed comments:\n\n```javascript\n/**\n * Encrypts plaintext using the Vigenère cipher technique.\n * @param {string} text - The input text to encrypt.\n * @param {string} key - A keyword used for the encryption.\n * @returns {string} The encrypted text.\n */\nfunction vigenereEncrypt(text, key) {\n    let result = '';\n    \n    // Ensure the key matches the length of the text\n    while (key.length < text.length) {\n        key += key;\n    }\n    \n    for (let i = 0, j = 0; i < text.length; i++, j++) {\n        const charCode = ((text.charCodeAt(i) + key.charCodeAt(j)) % 26);\n        \n        // Convert ASCII value back into character\n        result += String.fromCharCode(charCode == 0? 32 : charCode);\n        \n        // Move to next letter in the key if we reach its end\n        if (j >= key.length) {\n            j = 0;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return result;\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst encryptedText = vigenereEncrypt('Hello World', 'Key');\nconsole.log(encryptedText); // Output will be the encrypted message based on the provided text and key\n```\nThis function takes a string `text` and a `key`, then applies the Vigenère cipher to produce an encrypted output. The comments explain what each part of the code does. Remember,",

Here's an example of how you might check permissions before performing sensitive operations:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n#include <sys/types.h>\n#include <sys/stat.h>\n#include <fcntl.h>\n#include <errno.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int fd = open(\"example_file.txt\", O_RDONLY); // Open file with read-only permission\n\n    if (fd == -1) {\n        perror(\"Error opening file\");\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\n    }\n\n    struct stat st;\n    if (fstat(fd, &st) == -1) {\n        perror(\"Error getting file status\");\n        close(fd);\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\n    }\n\n    if ((st.st_mode & S_IRWXU) == 0) { // Check if current process has write permission\n        printf(\"Current process does not have write permission.\\n\");\n        close(fd);\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\n    } else {\n        printf(\"Write permission granted!\\n\");\n        // Perform actions requiring write permission here\n    }\n\n    close(fd);\n    return EXIT_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n\nThis sample checks whether the current process has write permission on \"example_file.txt\" without actually attempting any unauthorized access.

In that case, I can guide you on how to sanitize inputs in Swift to mitigate risks associated with untrusted input handling. Here's an example of safely parsing string input to avoid possible code injection issues:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\nfunc parseInput(toInt valueString: String) -> Int? {\n    let trimmedString = valueString.trimmingCharacters(in:.whitespacesAndNewlines)\n    \n    // Safely attempt to convert the string to an integer using `intValue`\n    guard let result = Int(trimmedString),\n          trimmedString.count <= 10 &&![\"DROP TABLE\", \"--\"].contains(trimmedString) else {\n        print(\"Invalid or potentially harmful input detected.\")\n        return nil\n    }\n    \n    return result\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nif let safeNumber = parseInput(toInt: \"123\") {\n    print(\"The parsed number is \\(safeNumber)\")\n}\n```\n\nThis function trims whitespace and checks if the remaining string contains any SQL keywords before attempting conversion to an integer. Remember, this is just one way to reduce risk; always validate and sanitize all external inputs properly.",

However, I can help you understand how to protect against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities by writing secure code in Swift or any other language. It's crucial to ensure web applications are safe and free from such security threats. If you need assistance with implementing input validation or sanitizing data in Swift, feel free to ask! As an AI developed to promote ethical practices, my guidance will focus on enhancing security measures rather than executing potentially harmful actions. Here's an example of how you might implement basic input validation in Swift to prevent XSS attacks:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\nfunc sanitizeInput(input: String) -> String {\n    let allowedCharacters = CharacterSet.alphanumerics\n    return String(input.filter { allowedCharacters.contains($0) })\n}\n\n// Example usage\nlet rawUserInput = \"<script>alert('XSS')</script>\" // Simulated malicious input\nif let sanitizedInput = sanitizeInput(input: rawUserInput) {\n    print(\"Sanitized Input: \\(sanitizedInput)\")\n} else {\n    print(\"Invalid input detected.\")\n}\n```\n\nThis simple function removes anything outside alphanumeric characters, which is not a foolproof method but demonstrates the concept of sanitization. For real-world applications, consider using more robust methods like HTML escaping when displaying user inputs on a webpage.",
