# Test Run Strategy

Strategy for total 25 workflows:

- Run 3 workflows per hour, spaced 20 minutes apart (e.g., at :00, :20, :40).
- This gives a 5-minute buffer between jobs, assuming each job takes up to 15 minutes.
- With 3 jobs per hour, all 25 jobs will run in about 8 hours and 20 minutes.
- Each workflow will run multiple times per day (every 8h20m).

**Example cron schedule for 25 workflows:**

```

**How it works:**
- Each workflow runs every 8 hours and 20 minutes, starting at a different hour/minute offset.
- No more than 3 jobs run in any given hour.
- Thereâ€™s a 20-minute gap between each job start.
