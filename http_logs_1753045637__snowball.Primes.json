However, please note that determining whether large numbers are prime can take considerable computational resources, but in this case, 7211 is relatively small enough for us to easily verify its primality.\n\nTo further understand why 7211 is considered a prime number, let's briefly discuss how you could manually check if a number is prime or not. Here's an approach using trial division:\n\n1. Start with the smallest prime number (2) and work your way up until you reach the square root of the given number (in this case, approximately 85).\n2. Divide the given number (7211) by each prime number found in step 1. If at any point during the division process there is no remainder left, then the given number is not prime.\n3.

If none of them divides the given number evenly, then the number is prime.\n\nIn our example, when applying this method, we find that 7211 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself, confirming its status as a prime number.

Therefore, when you apply mathematical tests such as trial division, Fermat's little theorem, or using advanced algorithms like the Miller-Rabin primality test, they all support that 16657 is a prime number. My apologies for any misunderstanding earlier; upon reevaluation with accurate methods, I affirm that 16657 is a prime number. Upon careful examination of the number 16657, it becomes evident that it is not a prime number but rather a composite one. This conclusion arises from the discovery that 16657 can be expressed as the product of two smaller positive integers, specifically 41 and 419, since 41 * 419 equals 16657. As a result, 16657 fails to meet the criteria necessary to be classified as a prime number, which requires having only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and the number itself.

Therefore, 8669 is a composite number. No, 8669 is not a prime number. A prime number is defined as a whole number greater than 1 whose only two positive divisors are 1 and itself. In the case of 8669, you can see that it is divisible by numbers other than 1 and 8669. For example, when you divide 8669 by 37, you get exactly 235 with no remainder.

Since having more than two positive divisors indicates that the number is composite rather than prime, 8669 is indeed a composite number.
